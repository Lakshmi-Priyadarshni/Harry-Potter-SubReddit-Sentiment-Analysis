There’s a whole generation of Harry Potter fans who have NEVER experienced StarKid’s A Very Potter Musical… and I’m here to fix that!
Would Harry have moved into his parents' home as an adult?
Independent studies at Hogwarts
Who deserved a more dramatic death?
"I feel Bellatrix Lestrange , I mean Neivell deserves to get the revenge for his parents"
Mad eye moody
" Sorry, Snape didn't have any heroic life, okay? 
So I will agree with you about Cedric's death, which was totally meaningless and random"

[Here's my favorite fanart of the twins by UpTheHill on tumblr in 2016!](https://www.tumblr.com/upthehillart/145760951239/weasley-brothers-see-also-ron-ginny-arthur)
My tier list after recently rewatching and rereading
"This is pretty dogshit. Sometimes the choices are so baffling I can’t even tell if you’re serious/what your criteria even was. If this isn’t serious, then you just wasted your own time and ours, because it’s not really funny or anything"
"Harry, Lily,James,Sirius,Dobby, Hedwig, Hagrid are the GOATS, rest are irrelevant to alright."
Is this serious list? Or a troll?
"I…think we’d have a discussion for so long our friends would leave us lol

There’s so many I don’t agree with! Haha I’m gonna make to examples out of the top and bottom tiers just for fun.

James Potter at the bottom…wow. If you are talking about power you’d be wrong. This guy managed to become an a animagus while in school. He’s got talent. If you are talking about character…he changed. Yes, he was a bully but! At the same time, he had Peter pettingrew (a dumb dude) and a werewolf in his close circle of friends. He was a gray character who made some mistakes but was good deep down and, in time, he grew and became a better person. Definitely not bottom tier.

And Snape. Oh my god Snape. Top tier, super awesome…just no. If it wasn’t for Dumbledore he’d have loved for James to die, probably even Harry to die, just to save Lily. Yes, he was super skilled, no doubt there! But character wise? Big no no for me. He did some good but, in my very humble opinion, he did it for two reasons only: personal gain and revenge. What he did he did either to gain something (first betrayal of Voldemort was to save Lily) or revenge (second arc, Voldy offed Lily so he wanted to get revenge). If he cared about Harry he’d have done so many things different. And even if he hated James so much he ended up hating Harry, he’d have no reason to behave the way he did. And don’t bring up the argument “when he was headmaster he managed to make the best out of a bad situation cause no one got killed”. He has the power and influence to make dramatically big changes in the school.

Ahhhh lol Snape top tier and James bottom tier makes me so mad lol two morally gray characters who had chances to grow and they get sorted like that. Snape betrayed people, cheated and did every bad choice ever. Top tier. James was a bully, changed his life around, grew up to be a good person and had a family and normal life. Bottom tier. So wrong!

Ps: don’t take this personally! These are dumbass opinions about a fictional book lol I honestly have a lot of fun with arguments like this!"
"Harsh on Bathilda, she’s only in it once she’s a corpse."
Overall I didn't mind Krum.  I would have put him more in the Irrelevant category.
I feel like a dolt (especially for a ravenclaw) but what does it even mean?
Most [goated character ](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D22AQFm8eEQQwURsg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1640084904450?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7CoVN6Vp-WB3mnf-__piET9t-nz0FM2pmzofHY_9cXU)didn't even make the list
Everyone has their own opinions idk why people are hating so much.
Marketing idea for the new series
What would happen if Harry joined Voldemort at the end of the Sorcerer's Stone (movie)?
"Well, it’s impossible to resurrect the dead, so Harry will be disappointed. Voldemort will try to kill Harry again because of the prophecy, but will fail. But he will have his body back and will start his reign of terror again a few years early. Alternatively, Voldemort could hold off on trying to kill Harry and string him along for a while until Harry figures out he can’t actually bring his parents back."
Honestly one of them Will betray the other
The authors of a new essay collection about Rowling's original plans for the Order of the Phoenix are doing an AMA today on /r/HarryPotterBooks
The AMA will be happening in the linked thread on /r/HarryPotterBooks. Please go there to ask any questions.
Why bellatrix joined death eaters?
"You can have whatever headcanon you want, but respectfully, she's completely psychotic, believed in his cause, and openly bragged about the atrocities she committed.

She can do all those things but love her sister, but nothing in the story suggests that she values her sister more than Voldemort."
"She's psychotic. 


And she clearly had no issue with putting Andromeda in danger."
">I belive she joined death eaters to protect only thing that she had left from her family her sister Narcissa

I’m confused about how you came to this conclusion. What did Narcissa need to be protected from? How does Bellatrix joining Voldemort protect Narcissa?"
"Dumbledore about Tom:


>“As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.


I reckon Bellatrix was one of the thuggish..."
My wife said this is a Death Eater...
Voldemort would lose his following to the new dark lord.
More like a heart eater
Funny as wife!!! She a keeper bro!!
"No that's, a Sith Lord."
Hahahahahahahaa tell her that it is too cute for a death eater
He is even stronger than Voldemort: He has a nose and Voldy no😰
this pic goes hard😎 def a death eater
We do not speak his name.
Why do people compare scholomance to harry potter ? Just for the sake of discussion
"I thought you were talking about the dungeon in WoW for a moment there.

While I've never heard of those books it does sound similar to HP in terms of it being a story about teens going to a magical boarding school but that's hardly an original idea. Even before HP there were books like Earthsea that had magical schools."
"This past Thursday, I saw Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (first time in US theaters) and then on Sunday I saw Deathly Hallows Part 2 (first time seeing with an Orchestra)!"
"Where did you see Deathly Hollows pt 2 with an orchestra?!!

I need to do this ASAP."
"Never knew that there was a different version of the movies. I'll have to look into it.

That hall is beautiful! I saw the first movie with the symphony and it was an amazing experience. My daughter plays in a youth symphony and also had an amazing time. It was really inspiring."
The right way vs the Ron way
..the irony is that with Trelawney…that probably would have worked as long as he also threw in some tragic stuff in there😂
This one is actually pretty funny.
🤣🤣It took me a while to get. But that was probably because my dumbass thought of Divination as Transfiguration.
Someone explain ne this please
How does the general fanbase feel about the movie's depiction of souls?
"Normal, not a difficult thing to do"
Acceptable.
Eh
Pre-Hogwarts Education
"Times are tough, even in the Wizarding world"
What happened to all of his gold?
Thats worth it just for the fire artwork.
I wanna take your opinions on this
What happens to the students who destroys their cauldrons?
He can likely just order them for delivery from a shop in Diagon Alley like Harry ordered a potions book in Half Blood Prince.
"Reparo

Either by Snape directly, or perhaps it's part of a charms class for OWL or NEWT students. Just repair broken down cauldrons. The freshly repaired one's are sent to the dungeons for storage until they are needed, while newly broken one's are sent upstairs to be mended.

It's why Hagrid stops Harry from buying a very expensive golden Cauldron and instead insists on him buying a Pewter one."
"They likely use repairing spells. The kid gets a different one while the other one is mended, and then they get theirs back. I bet a lot of kids leave theirs behind when they graduate too. I bet there's a storage area chock full of used cauldrons."
"They owl-order a new one. Then, Percy gets to add to his report on the thickness of cauldron bottoms."
"*Reparo*, most likely."
I’m sure the school has some extras until his grandmother sends him a new one. If it was a student poor enough to need the scholarship fund I’m sure the school would give them one of theirs.
amazon owl
Combination of repairing charms and just ordering a new one
Actors Who Were Almost In The Films. Which Of These Castings Do You Like/Dislike?
nah mr bean as voldemort is evil
I can absolutely see Hugh Grant as Lockhart
Tim Roth being too old and yet 15 years younger than Alan Rickman
I'm glad pattinson got casted and started his career. Dude is a magnficient actor and all the movies he's in these days are easy 9+/10.
Hugh Grant as Lockhart would’ve been fun
How were Haley Joel Osment and Robin Williams almost in the movies when JKR insisted on only casting UK actors?
Tim Roth too old for Snape? Dude is 15 years younger than Alan Rickman
Who was the person almost cats as Hermione?
Saoirse as Luna could’ve worked. Dunno about the rest. Maybe Tilda.
Hugh would have played a great Lockheart 🤩
What three Harry Potter movies should I show my GF?
If only there was an order for the series….
"1,2 and 3"
You do realize that the series isn't disjointed for you to randomly pick three films?
"as nice as the later movies are, how dumb would it be to start in the middle of the series"
"Just one, Deathly Hallows part 2. I'm sure she'll understand the rest of it from context."
"I mean, 1, 2, and 3? Lol. No way watching them out of order would do her any good."
You can't just watch movies out or order.
"You could do 1, 3 and 4.
 Tell her about the second but, despite  me hating the 4th, it is the most liked by those who havent read the book"
"Ask her would she read one book instead of watching 3 movies? If she's an avid reader, that would be better to get her hooked."
Just start at the beginning
What was Tom Riddle's motive for chasing immortality from a young age?
"Given that his mother died giving birth to him, I would say that he was already aware of death from such a young age."
"I don't know his full motivation, but I think his mother dying plays quite a part. He even says that his mother could not have been where he got his wizard blood from since if she were a wizard she would not have died. 

Note that when he approaches Slughorn, he is already far on the path to immortality, since he only comes to ask if it's possible to make multiple horcruxes. He's already made the ring at that point by killing his father and grandparents and making Morfin Gaunt take the fall for it."
Tom had an irrational fear of death. I'm guessing he's such a control freak he's scared of something he can't stop or understand what happens after.
Do you need a specific reason to want to not die?
"If i am not wrong Dumbledore himself answered that question I'm not sure if it was book number 5 or 6.
But he mentioned something like voldemort thought that his father had to be the wizard bc his mother died the day he was born so noone who had an special talent like magic could die that easily.
So when voldemort found out that his mother was a witch and died he got scared of death so that he tried to find the way of obtaining immortality"
Because ghosts can’t scratch their noses.
"His mother died.

He doesn't think as a wizard he should ever die."
"I think it’s a combination of narcissism, his mother dying during childbirth, and living during the Blitz."
Plot :)
"I dont know that the books explicitly say why, but from what I gathered its because Tom is a narcissist. He sees himself as better than everyone - muggles and other wizards. Wizards at the time have long life spans, but even so no one is technically immortal in the series. Achieving immortality would have established him as the most powerful wizard, and would have allowed him to exert that power endlessly. He was also sort of afraid of death, so he wanted to conquer it (hence his later obsession with the Hallows).

Edit to add: he kind of works as a foil to Harry in this way. Both  face loss to death at a young age, however this loss motivates Harry to protect his loved ones whereas Tom is motivated i
to protect himself."
Say something nice about Weatherby
It takes a lot of courage to admit you were wrong.
He was right about cauldron bottom regulations. It is important for health and safety.
"1. It certainly takes some bravery and self awareness to admit you screwed up big

2. He was ambitious about doing big in his career, even if the way he went about it was terrible

3. He certainly had brains and magical abilities given he was consistently a good student and a prefect/head boy in school"
"Dude came back to fight when it was time, and admitted he’d been an ass."
"I think his personality is a direct result of being sandwiched between Bill/Charlie and Fred/George. He had no partner growing up like his brothers did, and his rigid, Type-A personality likely clashed with them. It likely created a lonely kid who overcompensated for being left out by being “above it all”, to the point that just became who he was. 

I think it also explains why Molly tends to show some favoritism toward him. She felt sorry for him—not realizing it was breeding more resentment for his siblings to harbor toward him."
He's a good student at school ig?
He's a hard worker
"Even though he was a real prick who loved to throw his authority around to get his way, more often than not he was just doing his job as prefect and enforcing school rules that were reasonably designed to keep the students safe."
When I was younger I had a crush on him because I thought the actor was cute.
He's the reason Fred died smiling
Who Do You Think Was The Biggest Miscast Of The Series?
"I know there’s reasons for it but my answer will always be James and Lily when we do get to see them. 

So much older looking and honestly if they were younger actors I think there’d be way more impact visually, they were so young when they died and that’s half the tragedy"
"Barty Crouch......JUNIOR!

I love David Tennant, but moustache twirling, lip licking, tongue flicking obvious villain was so different than the complex Barty from the books. 

Plus casting an actor as big a name as Tennant means they had to give him more to do in the film, leading to additional scenes in the beginning, thus completely ruining the mystery of Goblet of Fire"
Viktor krum... he wasn't supposed to be good looking and buff... the description made him closer to the way Snape looks than how the actor was
"Kid Lily, for sure. She had James' eyes. And my personal pet peeve Tom Riddle from Slughorn's memory. Ugh oh that was baaad"
'HARRY POTTAH DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE!?' Dumbledore Cruciod calmly.
"Gary Oldman. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a fantastic actor. But that casting ruined Movie Sirius for me."
"I know it will offend everyone, but Emma Watson as Hermione. She’s just the weakest of the trio unfortunately. Which is not in any way a commentary on her as a person, I’m sure she’s lovely, but her acting isn’t great.

All of Harry’s parents era actors. They were all really talented but not the appropriate age for the characters, it looks a bit strange. I could maybe excuse Sirius and Remus, who are explicitly described as prematurely aged, but for the others it’s a bit odd.

These movies were a massive undertaking and I think everyone worked really hard to make them happen, and it shows in the product even though I’m personally not a fan of the movies."
"The Marauders. They were all way too old for the parts. I know you can say “but we didn’t find it until later that they were only 21!” But if Rowling told AR from day 1 about Snape being a double agent, she could have told the director/casting that they needed to be younger. I guess it’s because they wanted AR and then aged them up accordingly. But I think that was a mistake."
Robert Pattinson maybe?
ITT: other people’s opinions making me unreasonably angry
How can everyone find the Potter house after their death?
"The owners of the house died, and the house blew up. The Fidelius charm protected the secret of where James and Lily Potter live. That secret no longer exists, so the charm doesn't exist anymore either.

Hagrid would have known the location either by virtue of being told beforehand, he was apparently somewhat friendly with, or at least known to them. Or more likely Dumbledore simply told him. 

As for the others, it was the site of a major historical event, that kind of information spreads."
"For Grimmauld Place the secret is the house itself.

In the Potter's case the secret was them living there. People could have always seen the house, they just wouldn't have been able to see the Potters living there or see any clue as to them ever having lived there."
It’s answered in the book. In DH it says “The Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily” when Harry sees that lots of people had written him good luck messages on the memorial sign at the gate. It has nothing at all to do with Hagrid.
"I mean the house blew up, the owners are dead, what’s the fidelius charm supposed to protect now?"
"The fidelus charm was protecting the secret of the Potter’s location, not the house itself. Once they were dead the secret was no longer needed, effectively breaking the charm, even though the SK (Pettigrew) was still alive in this case."
The Fidelius charm was broken when Lily and James died. There was nobody to protect anymore.
"The fidelius charm was not broken by Dumbledore, but it was broken by Pettigrew. He sold them and broke the charm."
"Hagrid probably knew where the house was before even Harry's parents being dead, he was their friend and a member of the Order. The tourists left messages on a sign outside the house, not inside the actual house"
"In Dealthly Hallows, why didn’t the trio fight off the 6 snatchers?"
They were caught off-guard. You can't expect them to stop to think rationally to decide the best course of action.
Because they're stupid
Didn’t like Harry’s broken wand backfire on him or something?
I have some mind boggling questions on polyjuice potion for real HP nerds.
"I think most of your questions are hard to answer given the information that is provided to us.

For example there is no real way of knowing what would happen if you used a 10 year old hair.  If you think about it is already interesting that Barty Crouch even copied Mad-Eye's missing leg and eye, which seems to imply that the potion does not necessarily work on a DNA basis and rather just does a copy of the persons exterior at the moment you acquire a piece of them. This then does NOT answer why he does not look as sick as the original Mad-Eye.

The question that CAN be answered fairly easily though is how to brew polyjuice potion of a bald person. You don't need a person's hair, you just need a piece of them. This could a fingernail, it could be a bit of saliva, it could be an eyelash."
He wasnt weak maybe because he was eating proper food and wasnt trapped in darkness unlike moody in trunk. There isn't enough information in source material to answer your questions.
"I can't answer the other questions but I know this one: it doesn't need to be hair. It has to be a part of that person, that's all it says in CoS. Hair is simply the easiest to obtain, that's probably why it's the only thing we see people using. But they talk about having to drink Crabbe's and goyle's toenails in CoS. As disgusting as it is, it would be an option."
Short answers for all of these: JK Rowling didn't think this far.
"1. J.K. Rowling didn't think about it. Logically it should work like that I think.

2. It seems to require genetic material, so I would assume they would still transform in the actual person, and not their polyjuiced variant, since I doubt the potion changes genes, just appearance.

3. Nick some body hair I guess? Trickier and awkward but not impossible. Still has the required genetic material.

4. Interesting, that might fix the BCjr thing actually. Maybe he took the hairs before moody actually got sick. Take all the hair at once. Since the genetic material isn't updated, it would reflect it at the time where it was 'picked' I guess?

5. Eternal outward youth, yes. I'm assuming your organs etc don't actually change. For example, could someone who transforms into someone with a uterus get pregnant? What happens if they transform back and don't have the uterus anymore. I think it's just outward appearance. I guess looking young forever ain't a bad deal though.

6. Ideally the person is alive, since then they can still grow hair. I assume a dead person would work if you pick it before decay/cell death starts setting in. You would have a finite supply of hair though!"
No sports at all in the wizarding world? Except Quidditch?
"In America there's Quodpot, which is the analog to American Football. Broom racing is also a professional magical sport. There's more about this in Quidditch Through the Ages."
"In the extended lore. There are mutiple games that are all played on brooms. 

Not mentioned, but the Firebolt is described as a ""racing broom"" so there is probably broom racing as a sport"
"Quidditch is the biggest, they say that pretty frequently. So you can assume there are other sports but the plot didn't require explaining them. Harry got obsessed with quidditch, not running track and field."
"Chess exists in universe, so presumably other board games are played too"
Don’t forget Summoners Court from Hogwarts Legacy
Does dueling count as a sport?
Muggle baiting
I would have liked if JK Rowling explored more about Ron's chess capabilities. Harry would have been Quidditch champion meanwhile Ron should have been chess champion.
Don't forget gobstones :-P
"I wish they had a magical version of soccer where the headers went 100 feet in the air, zoomed around and went in the direction of the worst player on the pitch because the ball could detect it. Like whoever was playing the worst that day in that moment, in the worst position, ball goes to them. 

Also, you can cast stunning spells to block shots, but you only get one per game per person. Chose wisely."
Why is it in the American cover of the deathly hallows Harry defeats Voldemort in the Roman Colosseum?
"""Yer a gladiator, Harry"""
It's the Great Hall's ceiling. It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in 'Hogwarts: A History'
"Since the great hall’s ceiling looks like the sky outside I’d guess that is just the great hall, those are windows on a curved wall."
So I bought this at midnight release. Have had it sitting on my bookshelf since then. Have read it over 20 times at this point. And have somehow never realized this was meant to be the great hall until reading these comments
"""My name is Harry James Potter, Finder of the Horcruxes of Voldemort, the Boy Who Lived, loyal servant to the best wizard of the Wizengamot, Albus Percival Wulfric ^(Brian) Dumbledore. Son to a murdered father, and also to a murdered mom. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next."""
"For anybody doubting that this is the great hall, [this is the full illustration](https://imgur.com/HpA74MN) in which it is very clearly depicting Voldemort's defeat. Which was in the great hall."
That's the Hogwarts Great Hall.
"Not just American by the way, I know for a fact same cover was used for the Polish edition when the books were coming out."
Because it’s where all roads inevitably lead.

I’m not surprised this post is getting downvoted…whether I agree or not. The Potter fandom does not like it when their universe gets mixed with others.
"Inspired by a post yesterday. This part always makes me tear up a little. (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, chapter 34: The Forest Again)"
Hogwards
"It's a rare moment of connection with Snape and Voldemort, because even though they are mortal enemies, they share something so unique. They found a home in Hogwarts, one is trying to destroy it, the second one is trying to defend it and the third is caught in the middle through his tragic love story."
Hogwards?
"To Snape Hogwarts was not the dream place he expected it to be. It brought him further suffering. But it was still his home, he spent there almost 24 years of his short life and he chose to stay and die for the innocents there."
The forest again is the best chapter of the entire series.
"It’s truly painful. It’s sad that Voldemort felt it was a home but couldn’t overcome his past. That Snape went down the same road and overcame it too late. It feels like unknowingly and unintentionally, Harry learned from their mistakes, but who knows what would’ve happened if Ron hadn’t needed a seat on the Hogwarts Express first year?"
The abandoned boys...what a line
"Yeah, bad spelling makes me tear up too."

"Not sure if it would work because it’s aVAda keDAvra, not avaDUH keDAvra or aVAda kedaVRAAA."

"Im a bavarian and i thought He says ""SERVUS, ..."" in the beginning. Its a cozy bavarian greeting. Love it"
Why didn’t the gang visit Dumbledore’s portrait after he died?
"Dumbledore sleeps while Harry is in Dumbledore’s office and after that they are sent home.

And after that, the school is in Voldemort’s hands."
"They thought that they knew enough. They realises they don't in deathly hallows, and the second Harry was free he went to the headmasters office to speak to dumbledore but his portrait wasn't there"
"The main reason is that they weren’t at Hogwarts much after that anymore; at least not long enough to get any major advice. And speaking of that, there wouldn’t have been anything to gain from asking it anything anyway; magical portraits are just memories/representations of the original person, not actually them. It would have just given generic responses and platitudes in the style of Dumbledore; nothing really practical. It can’t actually “think.” All of that and Harry was probably a little bitter with all of the secrets and revelations he found out afterwards about Dumbledore that he likely wouldn’t have considered it for long."
"They knew basically everything the real Dumbledore did about the Horcruxes (or *thought* they did, at any rate), and talking to an A.I. imitation of him would've been pointless- not to mention *horrible*, considering how fresh their grief was.  By the time they realized how out of their depth they were, Hogwarts was under Snape's control, and they couldn't risk breaking in."
"I think they were grieving and in shock because of Snape's 'betrayal'. So they didnt think to visit it to ask questions.

And even if they did think of it, McGonagall was deputy head, there was no chance to visit the portrait because of her being there and all of the Ministry people visiting her office.

I dont know if the portrait would have been helpful. Dumbledore was all about the gang finding stuff out for themselves so he might just have talked in riddles or pretended to sleep or something."
The portrait was asleep when whey went to the office.
"The portrait isn't *really* Dumbledore, more like an interpretation of Dumbledore infused into a painting. He (the painting) probably didn't know much about it."
"Why didn't Dumbledore gave the trio a portrait of him as inheritance since he knew he was going to die?

Because in life he told them what they needed to know. At least the most of it. Harry knew he needed to destroy Horcruxes and Dumbledore wanted hollows to be a slow burn so he doesn't get corrupted by the idea. He didn't know where any of the Horcruxes were and Harry shouldn't know about Snape until the very end.

What information they should have gotten from the portrait?"
"They could have tried to ask Dumbledore for post-death advice via his Chocolate Frog cards, too."
"My mother's Harry Potter collection, proud of her! She's going through tough times and her collection helps her pushing through <3"
How fun!  What a great collection!
I wish we got to see more diversity in houses
"I agree some more house representation would have been welcome, but come on; Bellatrix in Hufflepuff? Loyalty is of course a huge Hufflepuff trait but look at the other ones: Patience, Fair Play, Friendliness, Accepting Of Everyone, Strong Morale Code, Honest, Impartial….I could keep going lol. Any of that sound like Bellatrix?"
"I love this idea of how any house traits taken to the extreme could create a villain. Wasn’t that one of the themes in the Divergent series? I only read the first two but I thought it was possibly headed that direction.  

It’s a fun idea for sure, but I also like the direction Rowling went with the idea that the sorting is largely based on what people want to be, more so than what they are."
"I mean Bella definitely is not a Hufflepuff but you make an interesting point.


I think a villain from Ravenclaw would've been interesting and believable. As they say ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"" plus there are plenty of cases where the most scientific/logical thing is the cruelest."
"No , this isn’t supposed to be a fan made up serious . I really hope they don’t deviate from the actual books."
"each house has multiple values so Bella being loyal is not enough to get her into Hufflepuff since it is the only trait she shares with the house. However this is a new take on diversity. But look at a couple of Slytherin values cunning and ambitious, these are traits typical seen in villains rather than wit or fairness or chivalry"
"The thing is that since the series is focused on mainly Gryffindor and Slytherin ,it makes sense that a lot of the people are in those houses. Even Ravenclaw got recognition because people like Quirrell and Lockhart were revealed to be in that house. Slytherin is shown as the evil house since the very beginning which is why a lot of dark wizards are in it. Hufflepuff has loyalty and friendliness as traits which are definitely not something you'd see in dark wizards which is why there's not a lot of diversity."
"You make an interesting point. I think the reason those concepts/ideas weren't explored more is because of the intended audience and narrative scope of the books. It wasn't really one of JKR's goals to highlight equity among the houses, rehabilitate Slytherin house's image, make Hufflepuff more prominent, etc. Maybe in an adult higher fantasy series told from different POV's that might've been a goal. I can definitely appreciate people wanting to see more of that, but I personally don't think it was an inherent fault."
What kind of Muggle technology do you think the trio would be using by the time of the Epilogue?
"Hermione would be very into technology - I could see her learning basic programming and such and definitely buying the latest technology to try out as it comes out. She would definitely have a laptop, smartphone etc. 

Harry, though raised in the muggle world, didn't really spend much time at home when he started school and wasn't even allowed to play on dudleys computer. I'd guess that he would have a rather rudimentary understanding of technology and be boomer like in his use of it.

Ron, much to Hermione's exasperation, likely wouldn't be too interested in it. 

Plus, it has to be considered that technology doesn't cope well w magic. So it's not so practical to keep one on your person when your magic would likely interfere w it working properly."
"Mr weasleys would love it

Maybe Hermione too, just out of curiosity

But other then that I can see them caring much"
"If someone figures out how to make magic and electricity play nice a lot of things would happen fast.

We really don't know enough about how spells and magical devices are made to know what a determined wizard could do."
"Ron would be watching tv ngl and Hermione would be learning the FUCK out of programming. Harry on the other hand would probably stay away from technology due to his past, with the Dursleys banning him from using the family computer"
"Well, we know Ron got his driving license. I reckon they have a tv as well if not a computer too"
computers and phones
Rereading chamber of secrets and then I realized
Wasn't it not even in service of the cult leader?  I think it's worse than that.  He had no idea it was a horcrux.  He mostly just wanted to embarrass Arthur and maybe kill some muggle kids and was willing to kill a pureblood in the process too.
"That sort of cutthroat ambition, disregarding or devaluing of others’ lives or feelings, is precisely what gets the Malfoys sorted into Slytherin house."
Yes he does this to give Athur a bad name. Dumbledore explains this at the end of the book.
There is nothing implying Lucius expected Ginny to die. Dumbledore speculted that it was to discredit Arthur.
"Yes, as someone mentioned he chose Ginny because of how it would reflect on Arthur. How it would look that someone in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts had a daughter going around killing ‘mudbloods’ essentially."
"I don’t know if he thought she would die, but I don’t think he would have cared if she did. He did it to get Arthur into trouble (and also Dumbledore).  Lucius didn’t know how the diary worked, he wasn’t selecting anyone to be “Voldemort’s vessel”. He thought Voldemort was dead, or he wouldn’t have dared go against Voldy’s order to keep the diary safe. So he wasn’t serving him by giving Ginny the diary, he just saw an opportunity to use it for his own personal gain. and when Voldy comes back he’s really pissed off about it."
can 10 people side along apparate with one person?
"If I remember correctly, there is no explicitly mentioned cap to the number of people doing side apparation. But presumably, the risk of things going wrong increases with the number of people."
We see Hermione apparate with 2 people and Dobby apparate with 3 but I don't think we're ever told what the limitations are.
"I feel like the more people that you try to take with you, the more likely people are to get splinched. Maybe that's wrong, but it would make sense. It's already a possibility just doing it by yourself."
"I don’t know, CAN they?"
"JKR needed to introduce portkeys early in GoF, so that's how the group travels to the Quiddich World Cup, but the Watsonian reason may be that a group of that size couldn't all apparate along with Arthur."
"Yes and you’re getting basically stuffed in a tube. 

Ouch."
I would assume there’s a limit or we wouldn’t have ever been introduced to portkeys or even floo powder as the Wesleys would have just side-long apparated their kids instead of spending that money. My guess is it gets increasingly difficult the more people you take with you and would take a huge amount of skill & magic for one person to transport 10 or 20 people if it’s remotely possible for anyone. There’s a risk of severely injuring yourself when it’s just one person so I’m guessing side-long apparition is *typically* limited to 1 other person.
I just finished all 7 books for the first time
If you want to be back at Hogwarts the best option is to get Hogwarts legacy
"Being 9 when Philosophers Stone came out meant I could read it in this order as they came out

1, 1,2, 1,2,3, 1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4,5, 1,2,3,4,5,6, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

Yeah I was a little HP nerd"
Go back and listen to the audio books haha...I recommend the ones narrated by Stephen Fry
"Immediately reread , you’ll notice about 20 new things"
"There are a TON of great books out there that will remind you of Harry Potter because they take place at magical schools or have a ton of supernatural creatures. Don't stop reading. Don't EVER stop reading. Through reading, you can travel the world from the comfort of your home, make a million friends, and fight a million wars."
"You read well written fanfiction. Draco redemption, hogwarts 8th year, first year they get into the workforce... time travel fix-its, and much more. Choose wisely, there is plenty of trash ther,e but you will find the gems you're looking for if you dig."
Buy and play hogwarts legacy?
"I'm 32 and in my younger years there was a period of time where I just started over every time I finished. 😅 I have read them 20-30 times in danish, 1 time in english and when I was pregnant, my son was listening to them in my belly. Do I need to tell you that my due date was 31. july (Harry Potter's birthday)? 😌 

... He arrived 3. august, that little bastard. Still so disappointed. 😂 He's probably a muggle. 😒"
Listen to the audiobooks. Stephen Fry version.
"I'm reading the goblet of fire right now, and I can totally relate to slowing down on the reading."
What subjects would the Hogwarts teachers teach if it was a muggle academy?
"For some serious answers:

\- Snape would either be Chemistry or Math, or maybe both (you're right on there lol)

\- McGonnogal would be English teacher

\- Flitwick would be the Physics teacher, or maybe the Social studies/geography teacher

\- Professor Binns would obviously teach History

\- Hagrid would teach Shop, or maybe Zoology if it's offered

\- Professor Trelawney would teach Drama/music

\- Lupin would be the History substitute that everyone loves because he's actually interesting to listen to

\- Dumbledore would be the principal that the students have respect for

\- Madam Hooch would teach Gym/Phys Ed

\- Lockhart would be the English sub that everyone hates because he's full of himself and doesn't know anything (also makes his own published works required reading)"
"McGonagall -Physics
Sprout- Biology
Flitwick- Music Theory
Snape - Chemistry
Sinistra- Astronomy
Hooch- Kinesiology 
Vector- Maths
Hagrid- Forestry
Trelawany- Cultural Anthropology 
Freinze- Philosophy 
Binns-History

Did I miss anyone?"
"This mental image made me laugh 

Snape. Interpretive dance and music. With his swishing cloak and all."
I could see McGonagall teaching English
"Mcgonagall: Physics. 

Flitwick: Mathematics. 

Sprout: Biology.

Snape: Chemistry. 

Pince: Literature. 

Promfrey: Anatomy. 

Binns: History.

Sinistra: Astronomy.

Babbling: Foreign language. 

Vector: AP Mathematics. 

Burbage: Social Studies. 

Filch: Vocational Studies. 

Hagrid: Wood Shop, Metal Shop.

Slughorn: AP Chemistry. 

Lupin: AP Literature. 

Lockheart: Arts.

Hooch: PE, Health."
Umbridge would be the dean of discipline
McGonagall is definitely an English/Literature Prof.
"All my math teachers were free spirits or absolutely plain people. Nothing remotely like Snape in any of them.

For some reason I see Flitwich as teaching Physics."
"Are we going by what wizarding world subject matches a real world subject, or are we going by the vibe of the teacher? I certainly can see McGonagall being an English teacher, but I don't see how transfiguration relates to it."
Snape would probably teach chemistry or home ex
Harry Potter baby shower I hosted this weekend
Those mandrakes are IMPRESSIVE. Well done!
This is adorable!! Best wishes to baby witch/wizard 💕
"Oh dear. These simply look fabulous. You went all in to do this. That's one lucky baby muggle. 
The wands, the potion bottles, the food from leaky cauldron. Just marvelous. Even the room has old timey vibes.

I must ask, was Dumbledore invited?"
Looks fantastic and well thought out. I bet the expecting couple were pretty happy with the results. 
I’m so impressed! Great job!!
That is so cute!
This is actually really cute! Well done!
I love it so much!!
That was so smartly done. The hall is so nice too!
I love this 😭
lol why was Barty Crouch allowed to preside over his own son’s criminal trial? 😂😂😂
Wizards need actual lawyers
"I agree with pretty much everything (though, to be honest, the trials following Voldemorts defeat were probably a circus), but I wanna point out that there’s only 1 penseive known to exist and it’s in the Headmaster’s office at Hogwarts. Plus, memories can be altered so it isn’t necessarily reliable"
"I think one of the underlying themes across the whole series is that their government and judicial systems are inherently flawed, largely as a consequence of war."
"Veritaserum (according to JK) and pensieves (according to HBP) are not canonically reliable.        

Yes, the wizarding justice system is super weird.         

I think the point with the Crouch trial (and the sentiment probably doesn't translate as well outside of Brittain) is that Barty is publicly doing his duty even at great personal cost.  It's a very old nobility notion very much ""stiff upper lip"".       

Hagrid is half giant.  He doesn't really have rights in the magical world.         

Sirius is thrown in Azkaban essentially as a war time prisoner and never tries to proclaim his innocence.  Even though Voldy was thought to be dead, there were still plenty of death eaters running around, and everyone thought he was in the inner circle."
"I think JKR was drawing parallels to the McCarthism style witch hunts in the 50s when making allusions to Crouch Sr. 

The wizarding world is not alone in having moments in history where trials being held were shams with the outcome already decided. That’s happened plenty of times in real life unfortunately."
Given his reputation there was no chance at Sr being soft on Jr
"I think it was because he was sufficiently powerful and sufficiently shamed that he was given the right to convict his own child in war time.

Seems normal honestly"
It always bothered me more that his WIFE was just… there with him? Co-presiding? But I think you answered your own question: they have a ridiculous justice system.
"Laws can be changed, Dumbledore!"
"It definitely would have made more sense for him to sit it out, but who's gonna tell him to?

He probably insisted on doing it to show how strongly the Ministry felt about not only Voldemort, but fully purging the wizard community of all his followers."
Peeves is responsible for breaking the vanishing cabinet…
Didn’t the Wesley twins shove a slytherin in it in year 5? And he appeared stuck in a toilet or something a couple weeks later?
Yup I gasped when I re-read that part knowing how pivotal it would be years later. And to think it would be over 5 years before it was referenced again!
AU idea: what if Peeves dropped the thing just a little harder
Fun fact: the death eaters attacking the long bottoms let to the death of Voldemort
Wait?  This is the first time people noticed this?
"Technically, Nearly Headless Nick is responsible for it, because he was the one who persuaded Peeves to do it so that Harry could escape Filch's punishment"
"the vanishing cabinet makes a lot of cameos before being introduced...

and i'm pretty sure Harry hides in the one that was in Borgin and Burkes in the beginning of book 2"
"Yea, and?"
were rules established how ghosts can interact with IRL physical stuff? Why couldnt the Hogwarts ghosts fight the death eaters ala the ghost deserters from two towers?
What would each of The Marauders see if they looked into The Mirror of Erised?
"Sirius- James, Lily, Remus, and Harry

Remus- Cured of his lycanthropy

James- His family and friends

Peter- IDK himself as a brave hero or something?"
"Assuming this is the teenaged/school versions of themselves:

Remus: himself without the scars/implying he was no longer a werewolf.

Peter: similar to Ron - himself as a popular kid, quidditch captain/headboy, etc with the rest of the Marauders looking at him enviously and admiringly

Sirius: standing with his family and friends all together, wearing Gryffindor colors and being inclusive. 

James: himself holding hands with Lily at their wedding, surrounded by their family/friends together and happy."
"In “A Very Potter Musical”, Sirius proves to Harry that he can be trusted by revealing he sees the same thing in the mirror that Harry does. Harry’s parents alive. I know that’s not from the actual story but it feels right to me that that’s what he’d see."
"When they were in school, Lupin would obviously see himself as not a werewolf, Sirius might see his family but reformed and not the pure-blood obsessed crowd they are, James would see himself with Lily, and Peter would see himself successful and popular."
Sirius would most definitely see Lily and James alive and with Harry.
Long term Imperio is interesting...
"I don’t think it’d have to be super specific for things like long term control/espionage. You could tell them to live their life as normal, except also discretely undermine something/Keep me informed about something/Await to obey further instructions. Then further add on that they should only act in ways they feel they wouldn’t be suspected. So the affected person themselves would try to avoid being detected. It wouldn’t be perfect, ofc, there’d still always be the risk of someone figuring out the victim is imperiused, but the victim would act as more of an aware double agent rather than a mindless drone.

It would take concentration and presumably relatively close contact to initially successfully cast, but once the victim is cursed, the curse just sticks to the victim like a charm on an enchanted object, and the caster can leave and stop concentrating on the curse. Although I wonder if to give new commands you’d have to physically get the message to them through your voice or a message, or if you could just magically ‘telepathically’ give them new commands by just like, concentrating on sending them new commands through the curse. Whether or not or how often you’d have to recast it to recharge it I would imagine would depend on how much the victim tries to resist it."
"Currently reading Deathly Hallows - Dean, Tonks and Griphook"
"I hope the HBO series is much richer rivalling GoT. 

There are a lot of parallel storylines that they can run: 
- Sirius on the run in GoF, and his detective work to help uncover the conspiracy behind the happenings at that time (Bertha Jorkins, Crouches, Moody)
- Dumbledore’s treasure hunt for the memories of Riddle and finding the horcrux locations
- Ron’s escape from the Snatchers
- Hermione’s detective work on the Basilisk and the Half-Blood Prince
- Sirius’ and Regulus’ back story from their respective PoVs
- Lupin as a spy with the werewolves
- Hagrid & Maxime’s diplomatic mission to the giants
- and some well known Muggle Borns on the run - Dean, Tonks as you mentioned and even the Weasley Twins with Lupin and Jordan on their radio station"
What are the odds they happen to be within ear shot of each other..
Secrecy of Wizards??????
Go ahead. You tell everyone your kid goes to a wizard school in Scotland. See how that works out for you.
Would you belive if someone told you their child is a witch/wizard and is going to a Wizarding school? It's not like they can do magic in front of muggles to prove it
"As Fudge points out to the Muggle Prime Minister, no one would believe him even if he told them. And if the parents got the kid to perform magic, the Ministry would be alerted and dispatch a squad to modify everyone's memories."
As others have said people would just think they were crazy and if they were somehow able to convince anyone the ministry would just send people out to erase the memories of anyone who knew likely including those Muggle parents.
"But who is going to believe you? If you tried to tell other people that magic is real and that your son/daughter is a wizard/witch and that dragons, centaurs and werewolves are real they'd think you're either telling a bad joke or are just crazy.

If you kept doing it and managed to convince others then the Ministry would show up, erase their memories and then have a stern word with you for willfully breaking the Statute of Secrecy."
I think the dragons are a bigger issue
Amazing illustrations by Tommy Lee Edwards
"I genuinely thought the first slide was a photo from the films. I had to double take, amazing artwork. 👏"
Is the fourth one McGonagal or Reeta Skeeter?
This guy loves spots and splatters.
Great work! Griphook is my fave.
He should have done all the official movie posters
Nice work
"Wow, very accurate! Did he ever draw Snape?"
"So cool! I haven’t seen most of the movies, who’s the woman in the green?"
The viiiibe
Was Harry an inherently good wizard because he was a horcrux?
The only confirmed thing being a horcrux let Harry do was talk to snakes and see into voldys mind. Otherwise it seems to have been all him. I personally wouldn’t like the idea that the only thing that makes Harry special is Voldemort.
"Harry had a piece of Voldemort inside him which gave him a psychic link to the Dark Lord, allowed him to speak to snakes, and gave him visions of Voldemorts mind and actions, however, we never see this connection be harnessed to magical ability nor Harry becomes weaker after stopping being a horrucrux.

It’s possible there’s some slight power boost but Harry comes from two very powerful wizards, is trained and mentored by another set of great wizards, and goes to become a distinguished auror way after he lost Voldemort’s soul piece."
Both his parents were extremely talented. He inherited his quidditch talent directly from his father who's to say he didn't inherit other magical abilities from them too?
"I don't think so. We see enough other instances of people being naturally talented for it to not be unusual. The things specifically confirmed as being related to Voldemort (eg. speaking parseltongue, the shared mind connection) are the only unusual things. All of Harry's other talents are really not extreme considering how many naturally gifted characters we learn about. *Maaaybe* his Quidditch skills are particularly unusual (he seems even better than James) but it's not like he would've gotten that from Voldemort."
"Not really. Two things he used to benefit from being a horcrux were having the ability to speak parseltongue and being mentally connected to Voldy but not anymore. After losing these temp abilities, Harry still soared to being the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement and he is the youngest one."
"I recently wrote on this sub how Harry could resist even Voldemort’s Imperius curse and some people instantly replied that is because of the Horcrux inside him. There is no indication of this either in the books or by the author. Stuff like Dursleys hated Harry because of the Horcrux etc. are all fan theories, not canon. The only canon information is that Harry can speak to snakes and see inside Voldemort’s mind because of the Horcrux. All other power is Harry’s own."
"He’s not an “inherently good Wizard”. As a matter of fact he struggled a lot. He had quick reflexes, good instincts and a mean Expelliarmus game. But other than that he was just slightly above average. 

But being able to cast a huge Patronus while Voldy’s soul lives in you is quite a feat."
Theory on Hufflepuff Commonroom Password
"What is this? And no, it's not apparition."
It's artistic license of apparition
"It's my most irritating change. As others have said, only Voldermort and later Snape can fly, this takes away from that moment after the seven potters when they are shocked/terrified that Voldermort can fly.

Also it's unbelievably on the nose, bad guys fly as black smoke and good guys fly as white smoke, that doesn't make any sense even if you've decided people flying as smoke looks cool for a film."
It’s book inaccurateness. 😓 They aren’t supposed to fly only Voldemort and Snape could do that in the books.
That's what happens when you leave an Oreo in milk for too long.
"Cloak and dagger ult, no further questions"
A much cheaper way of getting a bunch of adults to look like they're having a wizard fight while removing any chance it looks silly.
"It’s stupid. Voldemort flying without aid of a beast or broom was a holy shit cool moment, then Snape flies out of Hogwarts and you just gained a lot more magical respect for Snape. Him and Voldemort can fly??

Then the movies come out and it’s like, we all fly, we’re spooky black smoke flying monsters! So dumb."
"I can’t stand this effect. Especially since, in the books, flying is supposed to be this thing that only Voldemort knows how to do.

And it’s so on the nose, too. The death eaters are black smoke, the Aurors are white smoke. Give me a break."
Creative liberties by the filmmakers. I don't like that they shifted the story towards meaningless action.
When a dark wizard and a good (light?) wizard really love each other…
Facts from the books that you feel were a mistake not to include in the movies
Voldemort’s backstory with Merope Gaunt and Tom Sr.
"*The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog’s voice audible even above this din:* “Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!"
The marauders!!! Like... So much was left out!!! 😭
"Peeves, the scene with Ron, Harry, Ginny, and Dean in HBP. Also Dobby being the one giving Harry gillyweed. 

And SO MANY of the pensive scenes from HBP."
"
Peeves the Poltergeist. He was such a chaotic, hilarious part of Hogwarts, adding comic relief and a rebellious spirit to the school. His absence made the castle feel less alive, and we missed his iconic salute to Fred and George during their grand exit in Order of the Phoenix.

The Marauders’ Backstory. The movies barely touched on the friendship between James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter or their creation of the Marauder's Map. It robbed the Prisoner of Azkaban of emotional weight, especially when Harry learns how deeply connected he is to his father’s friends.

S.P.E.W. and Hermione’s Activism. Hermione’s crusade for house-elf rights in Goblet of Fire was a huge part of her character development. It showed her fierce sense of justice and willingness to fight for the oppressed, which deepened her role as more than just the brainy friend.

Harry’s Full-Blown Anger in Order of the Phoenix. While we get glimpses of his frustration, the movie downplayed the depth of Harry’s trauma and isolation. The raw, painful outbursts in the book made his eventual growth and resilience even more powerful.

Dumbledore’s Death Scene and Funeral. The movie rushed through this moment, but the book’s version was heartbreaking and majestic. The funeral, with magical beings from across the wizarding world paying their respects, highlighted Dumbledore’s far-reaching impact."
"Of Neville being possibly the chosen one, if Mouldy Voldy chose him instead of Harry which wasn’t mentioned in OOTP. 

As well as the story of Gaunts in HBP."
"I think they should have included the giant squid. Not for any plot reasons, but because I would have loved to see it."
"* Barty Crouch Jr's journey
* The Marauders' backstory
* Voldemort's backstory
* Umbridge being the one who sent the dementors after Harry
* Everything about the prophecy including Snape's involvement and Trelawney being the one who made It

I mean... Since PoA, the movies didn't explain shit"
"There are so many- but the main glaring one for me (I just finished the books) is how the face off between Voldemort and Harry went. In the movie they didn’t speak at all- and to make it more interesting they tumbled off Hogwarts- Wwhhat?! So stupid. All they had to do was include the dialogue and it would be much more interesting and it would tie up multiple things. They didn’t include his discussion in the headmasters office with Dumbledore’s portrait or that he fixed his original wand and was putting the elder wand back in Dumbledore’s tomb. It was like they dragged out the beginning of the deathly hallows so much they were like ope, we are out of time- end it!"
"Sirius mirror, the mirror shattering, and how Harry ended up bringing a shard of it with him on his journey"
I honestly think Harry Potter has good writing
Doesn't that also sound like apparated?
I always assumed he casted somekind of silencing charm before apparating since it was the middle of the night in a very quiet suburb
"I guess I always assumed that he apparated based on what we learn later, but I could be wrong"
"It's the same as Tonks beinf able to pack but not folding the socks. Her mother could, same spell work, different skill level. Same as Neville doing a spell VS Hermione or Harry in the DA. Just because everyone is doing the spell doesn't mean it doesn't vary from person to person."
He used magic
"She is a fantastic writer. She has the power to be able to engage the reader’s interests and imagination almost immediately, unlike a lot of fantasy writers (who unfortunately have the tendency towards expedition dumps and clunky dialogue) where it usually takes a several pages until you actually feel like you’re invested in the story.

Anyone who says stuff like “she was never a good writer anyway”—well, they’re just lying."
To the surprise of no one the person that is on their 11th read through of the Harry Potter books thinks they're good writing 😂
"There's also the possibility that it's the first part of the first book and the author hasn't sorted/figured out details for everything yet.

Later there's hand waving about 'this guy did it differently because he's special' or whatever."
I think the implication is quite obvious it was apparition?
"I mean it's probably apparition? Dumbledoor must be powerful enough to create a silencing charm around himself, if he was trying to be sneaky there's no way he'd want to make a huge cracking as he appeared and disappeared. Tho I do agree and I also think that she who must not be named was able to relay teenage emotions and thoughts pretty well, I found all the choices harry made pretty believable even if I didn't agree with his thought process. (E.g. Not telling anyone about Umbridge's child abuse)"
"This is just from my POV, so I might have it all wrong."
"I mean, you grow up muggle for over half your life, it’s bound to come out once every now and then. Especially when one of your best friends is injured and you’re not thinking straight."
This is rather like finding out to use the search function in a packed folder full of files
"I might not get it, but what is so muggle about this picture?"
I can't remember if the trio thought this at this point in the film but they thought harry still had the trace on him so couldn't use magic.
"i havent watched the movies in a bit, and just finished year 5 the first time, but i feel pheonix really dumed down unbridge"
Eh book Umbridge definitely did worse things but Imelda Staunton still played her masterfully and made her very hate-able in her own right
Arranged marriages?
"There‘s not really anything in the books that suggests that arranged marriages were a thing in the wizarding world, at least during the time the books were set. It would certainly be *expected* by families like the Blacks and the Malfoys that their children would marry other purebloods, but there’s no indication that they had formal arranged marriages and dowries.

Even if there was, I doubt any self-respecting pureblood family would agree to a marriage with Merope - the Gaunts had clearly gone off the deep end, with generations of inbreeding making them unstable and violent.

In addition, Marvolo wouldn’t receive a dowry for marrying Merope off. A dowry is paid by the bride’s family to the groom’s family. And obviously, the Gaunts didn’t have any money to pay a dowry with."
"For magical ""pureblood""  marriages, racism is the analogy. Think of the American South. No one had arranged marriages (not even in antebellum), but they had laws to prevent having relationships outside your ""race"" (""miscegenation"" ) until the 1967 Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia outlawed those laws.  Scarlett O'Hara (the Malfoys) would have the same approach as ""poor whites"" (the Gaunts) in this analogy. It's not *done.*

You can also think of South Africa. Marrying or ""having relations"" between the ""races"" (specifically ""European"" and ""non-European"") was a crime punishable by jail time until 1985. 

The elitism of separate spaces is a crucial part of racism, real or magical (""well at least we aren't *them*""), and didn't (and doesn't) require arranged marriages to fulfill the exclusion.


NB: Alabama was the last to remove their miscegenation law from their constitution in 2000-- by a 60/40 margin, which is *not* a big enough margin."
There's no arranged marriages. Just marriage expectations on pure bloods to marry other pure bloods by Slytherin pure bloods and possibly by other pure bloods who might have been Slytherins
"It’s not canon, because the books don’t say. But a lot of fanfics use this trope. I think that that current day wizards & witches have the Victorian attitude that you marry someone in your own class & family helps that along by making sure you meet the correct type of people."
For pure blood families there’s probably a lot of arranged marriages but over at half blood I think its less but still happens sometimes
How do you think the Wizarding World would have changed if Voldemort had never risen to power?
"Snape would have been a top inventor and researcher of potions and spells. Harry would become a professional quidditch player. Draco would still be a jerk but probably go on to have a good career due to his skills as well as Dad’s Ministry influence.

Pure blood mania existed even before Voldemort - look at the Blacks - and the Ministry was corrupt even then."
HP Book 1 front cover done
Does anyone else think that J.K Rowling created these Characters to show kids that you should never judge a book by its cover here?
Umbridge was an evil bitch from the first start though.
"Why do all of OP's comments end with ""buddy"""
"In the book, Umbridge is described as looking like a toad and she never made it a secret that she was evil."
That might have been part of it but I suspect it was more that she was writing Harry Potter in the style of Whodunits so almost every book has a plot twist villain.
"Umbridge was actually horribly cast if you're going by her book description.  She's literally described as being not only an evil bitch, but also being ""toad-like"" in appearance.  The descriptions of her are not flattering at all.

So, in the books at least, she was definitely a book intended to be judged by its cover."
"No Snape? Ugly Snape, in his dark clothes, yet working for the light?


Umbridge wasn't fooling anyone..."
"Umbridge is based on a teacher JK had while growing up. Being a teacher myself, there’s not many characters in the HP universe I hate more than Umbridge (although Snape’s treatment of Neville makes my blood boil!)."
I don't know I hated her from her first giggle and my instincts were right.
"Umbridge is an awful example.

Edit: Wow this is the first time I've ever noticed it's my cake day. Um lemme try something."
"Every one of them gave the first impression Ick, both on page and screen"

The first one is coolest
The second one

The second one seems like it would be a lot harder since there'd be less variability in the pieces
The second one is so badass!
I’d get both done and then frame them 😍

I think that the Dragon is called Chinese Fireball not Catalonian Fireball.
Was Grindelwald's defeat happening right after the use of the atomic bombs a coincidence?
"I would think the bombs would drive more followers to grindelwald, not to mention the overall destruction of the whole war. Which may have led to Dumbledore finally decided to put an end to his movement before the wizards decide to genocide the muggles."
Dumbledore won the elder wand from Grindelwald during their duel. The fact that dumbledore won while Grindelwald had the wand suggests he was actually being modest when he said they were equals.
Oppenheimer was a muggle who was put under the Imperius curse by Grindelwald to make the bomb for us to kill ourselves :)
"No.

Grindelwald was hiding in Japan. The A Bombs flushed him out.

17 years old starting with Harry Potter
Start with the first one. The first one or two will be a quicker read than the others. There are details in all of them that aren't in the movie or that are slightly different. It's worth starting at the beginning IMO
"Never too old start reading them. Start at the beginning and go in order. If you’ve only ever seen the movies, you’re missing *looots* of content."
Why don't you listen to the audiobooks? :) i think it's best to start at book 1 too
mate it's only 7 books and first two are the length of the fourth just read the lot
"I started with the first book when I was 18 or 19 and I didn't regret it.

Even though the first two movies are pretty accurate (as far as this is possible for a movie), there is still stuff left out. The first books aren't that long and if you really are worried that it will be too much to read all seven books, try the audiobooks."
"I'm 33, I re-read them this year for the X times, I still enjoyed the first ones."
"Always start at the beginning, there is much more in the books than the movies so you can miss things if you skip books.. the first book has much more info about the Dursleys and you can really appreciate how bad they actually are 😅"
That's a silly question. Why would you start a continuous story in the middle?
Honestly if you don't have an attachment to the idea of reading then just listen to the audiobook. There's 2 versions and both are good.
"I wasn’t allowed to read them growing up, so I didn’t read them until I was roughly 20. The first couple are definitely more aimed at kids, but they’re still very enjoyable, and set the stage for the rest of the series—the movies don’t miss as much in the first couple as they do later entries, but they’re still quite abridged, so you’re missing things with just movie knowledge. Just don’t expect anything deep in the first couple and enjoy the ride, they aren’t the type of kids’ book that’s agony for an adult to read.

If it’s easier for you, there’s also audiobooks as an option."
Snape and Occlumency
"Snape explains how his Occlumency works in OoTP:

>The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at Occlumency are *able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie,* and so utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.

Shut down *only* those feelings and memories that contradict the lie. Think of Legilimency like a search engine, and Occlumency as a filter that blocks certain results from coming up. Someone watching would not be able to know what the results without the filter would be like, thus they are unaware that the victim is using Occlumency."
"> or will they show other person things they want the person prying in to see?

I’m imagining that this is what it’s like. Snape being good at occlumency, he was probably able to show Voldemort memories that he wanted to see, or similar, without Voldemort knowing that’s what he was doing. "
"There are basically two schools of thought here: either he was or he wasn't. I tend to incline towards the former, but the latter has its arguments."
"Being a double agent, Snape gave information to the both sides, he hid just some parts that exposed his true final allegiance. For example, did he truly love Lily or she was nothing for him and he just wanted to possess her? The less you hide, the easier it is to lie."
I've always wondered this too 🤔 I'll come back to the post if anyone answers because I'm really curious
"A really good Occlumens would hide their own feelings and memories so well that an attacking Legilimens would not even suspect that Occlumency was being used at all. Of course, part of the difficulty is that Voldemort's arrogance would simply lead him to assume that nobody could successfully hide anything from him, which would prompt him to not try as hard as he should."
Why couldn't fawkes cure Dumbledore when he got curses from  ring ?? Or if Dumbledore had something like a philosopher stone would he be able to live a long long time despite being cursed ??
"Phoenix tears cure injuries, not curses."
"The tears are like a super effective antidote. The curse isn't necessarily a poison or disease, and most likely designed to be truly uncurable. Nicholas Flamel and his wife were dead by now, and Albus Dumbledore likely wasn't let in on the recipe for a new one since it was destroyed, nor would he have accepted it if they tried to give it to him."
I would assume it's the type of injury that can't be healed by Fawkes. Dumbledore only set up the scheme for Snape to kill him because he was already dying from the curse.
"It's extremely powerful dark magic, not a toxin. Dumbledore, the greatest and most knowledgeable wizard of his era (perhaps all time), could not think of any means to completely stop it from spreading and eventually killing him. I don't think the philosopher's stone would help him either, because extending your lifespan won't prevent you from being killed by an external force."
Because you can’t have a Heroes Story if the wise and powerful mentor doesn’t die first.
"Phoenix tears treat poisons and wounds, it is ineffective against curses. It, possibly, could have reversed the physical damage the curse was doing, but that would be nothing but a stopgap measure, it still would eventually spread and kill Dumbledore."
The simplest answer is that the plot needed him to die.
"Even if Fawkes could have cured the curse - which is questionable - he likely wasn't in a state to do so, considering that he had been hit by a Killing Curse just weeks prior."
Because at that time Fawkes was just a chick! He had saved Dumbledore’s life in the Ministry by swallowing the AK.
Dumbledore could've also just not worn the ring. He wanted to slowly die so Snape would actually kill him to prove his loyalty to Voldemort. Snape would've objected much more if Dumbledore hadn't already been dieing.
"What if Dumbledore survived , would it been easier to defeat voldemort??"
"It would take longer for them to figure out that Bellatrix had a horcrux in her vault, since the only reason the trio figured it out in the main quest was because she saw the sword and assumed they had robbed her, leading Hermione to realise that \_something\_ else is in the vault  along with the knowledge that Lucius had the diary. 

I do believe Dumbledore would eventually figure it out. Ultimately it would mean that Hogwarts is not attacked. Dumbledore will tell Harry he's a Horcrux and tell him he has to die so Harry will go to sacrifice himself. 

Then i assume Snape will be asked to kill Nagini, the order and Dumbledore organises a raid as Harry returns back to life, scaring the death eaters and most surrender or flee. Snape kills Nagini (he may or may not get killed after that) and then Dumbledore duels Riddle and defeats him. 

Since Harry sacrificed himself, the entire order is protected from harm from Voldemort, including Dumbledore, so beyond being the most powerful wizard in his generation and the master of the elder wand, Riddle litterally \_cannot\_ harm him. So Dumbledore just steamrolls through him, which again causes the few death eaters left to see him as weak and defeated. 

I'd imagine Bellatrix would go catatonic and have a seizure seeing Voldemort defeated right infront of her."
"It would have saved a ton of innocent lives assuming the ministry doesn’t fall as a result. We don’t know what the death toll was but it sounds like a lot just based on the few details Harry and co get, and I’m talking before the battle.

It could have meant book 7 would have been more of the traditional hp book, final battle could have been just Voldemort assaulting castle and everyone else coming in to stop him.

To keep the story most similar to how it is I guess Voldemort takes ministry but dumbeldore is able to hold hogwarts. So hogwarts is under siege and Harry Ron and hermonie are on the outside hunting horcruxes. I’d assume Snape would have been “revealed” as a death eater. Things could be pretty much the same till the end where the battle would be a little different, even Rita and the dumbeldore book."
This is like your third question in 15 minutes lol
he would have bossed that whole final battle while still allowing harry to do the deed.
Dumbledore surviving changes everything but ultimately not that much? It would definitely be easier to defeat He Who Must Not Be Named but at what cost?
"I imagine they would actually have a more difficult time with the horcruxes hunt. The trio only knew where the locket was because they sought refuge in Grimauld Place and happened to see RAB on Regulus’ door. They only found the cup because Bellatrix kept asking if they broke into her vault at Gringotts. They only find the diadem because Harry read Voldemort’s mind when Voldemort discovers the trio are hunting horcruxes. 

So, if Dumbledore lives, Hogwarts supposedly never gets into the hands of Voldemort. The trio never ditch their seventh year. Harry and Dumbledore probably spend a lot of time travelling to places that *might* have a Horcrux, but ultimately find nothing. "
What if Harry had a sibling
i dont think there was room for 2 in the cupboard under the stairs
"I think it would have been af twin! 

James and Lily where only 21 years old, when they died (31. october 1981). Harry was born 31. july 1980, which made him 1 year and 3 month old at the time they past.

That means Lily got pregnant around 12. november 1979. Lily and James were 19 years old. If Harry had an older sibling, that sibling would realistically have been born while they where still in school - someone would have noticed.

A younger sibling would have been 0-5 month old at the time, Lily and James were killed. Such a small child would have been in the house and Voldemort would have killed it.

But imagine the plottwist if Harry had an identical twin. 😂😱 That would have fucked that prophecy so much up..."
The story would be different for sure!
"Voldemort: *Deep inhale* ""Avada....."""
Harry's sibling would have to be his twin because Lily and James were young when they had Harry. They both died when Harry was 1.3 years old. If they both got pregnant after Harry's birth then the minimum age gap would be 10 months. A 5 month old baby is a free kill for Voldy.
I believe from the pressure and the amount of attention harry got they would join the dark side. would have been one hell of a plot thats for sure also I believe dumbledore would have hidden them somehow and harry would have found out too late which yes would ultimately affect his childhood and adulthood. and by hidden I mean an orphan or with a different name and life. perhaps even where the sibling lives in a completely different continent. also harry would find out through blood tests or whatever for gringotts. also the first part is for if they were together but with dumbledores involvement it seems unlikely.
You've written multiple posts with *space* then ?? after every sentence. Calm yourself. These questions are not that exciting.
[Theory] Horcruxes go both ways
"No, a horocrux is not formed out of “an ultimate act of love.” There’s a specific ritual, a planned murder, and murder is what splits the soul. 

The protection over Harry was sacrificial protection, generated by Lily’s sacrifice in begging to be killed in Harry’s place."
"No.  Souls are naturally meant to stay intact, and only murder damages them to the point where creating a Horcrux is possible- and it's a deliberate act that requires some sort of horrific ritual.  It's a mutilation and profaning of something pure and vital.

Lily's sacrifice was possible because she was given the chance to step aside and refused to.  The protection in Harry's blood isn't a fragment of her soul, or anything like that.  Just a powerful, primal enchantment."
"I don't think it's exactly a ""Horcrux"", since we know nthe process of turning a murder into one is far more complicated (and gruesome, alledgedly almost made JKR's editor throw up), but I do think in certain circumstances it can protect. Both love itself and whatever Lily did were described as ""ancient magic"", and the Potter family was under a great deal of spells when it happened. It could possibly require certain pre-existing circumstances (magic, blood purity, innate abilities, cause of death, etc.) to cast some kind of magic to assist someone. Voldemort killed James and Lily, so Harry was immune to it.

!redditGalleon"
"This feels like it undermines the major themes of the series. Murder splits your soul because murder is a horrible act and your soul is *meant to be intact*. Love splitting your soul makes absolutely no sense, even if it splits it gently or something instead of ripping it. The soul is supposed to remain whole."
How would you rank the Weasleys from your most to least favorite?

2. George (the twins are probably my favourite characters throughout the series)


3. Ron (he might be a bit rude sometimes, but he's very funny and a great friend)


4. Ginny (she's a late bloomer, but gods is she a joy to read when she comes out of her shell).


5. Molly (hard to decide between her and Arthur, but I love how much she cares about Harry)


6. Arthur (only second to Molly because he has a tendency to be a bit too quirky if you get what I mean)


7. Bill (he'd probably be higher if he'd been more impactful on the story)


8. Percy (yes, he's a bit of a pompous jerk who abandoned his family, but some character is better than the few scraps we're given with Charlie)


9. Charlie (as said earlier, he's simply the least developed Weasley brother, I still like him though)."

Japanese book covers have a darker tone art...do you like them?
I'm kinda triggered that they're not in order ngl haha
I love the Order of the Phoenix one. 
"Oh wow! Amazing!

Who are the 2 figures on the GOF cover?"
I love the POA and OOTP ones!
ohhh I like these!
I love them!
"A darker tone art...I think that is the least of the problem. Honestly, POA looks good but the rest kind of looks like nightmare fuel. Take PS. Is that white blop supposed to look like Hedwig? And is the...thing down in the right corner that in terms of colour looks exactly like the walls, meant to be Norbert? I respect others takes on the covers of the HP books; which I have seen several good designs, I am sure who did the art is skilled and I don't mean to talk bad about his/her skills but most of these covers are not good in my mind"
"Not personally, no.  They're *interesting*, but they don't remotely appeal to me."
I love Harry Potter and the Harry Potter Half Blood Prince

Unpopular Opinion: I loved Harry Potter and the Cursed Child
My favorite angle is the dynamic between Albus and Scorpius. It's the only reason why I consider the story canon.
"Me too. There are dozens of us! Dozens! 

But truly, the play is really cool and, yeah, meant to be seen and not just read. I'm hoping the US tour and upcoming productions throughout the world will get Cursed Child some more fans."
"It’s not an unpopular opinion. In fact, liking it as its own thing, but not considering it canon is pretty normal here.

People just don’t like that JKR considers it canon."
"I agree. My wife surprised me with tickets and I absolutely loved. Book is unreadable. Don’t even think mine has any creases in the spine. 

Get past the fan fiction comments. Get past how horrible the book is. And you’ll experience an amazing show."
"Me too! I've seen it over 20 times, already twice in the past week, and I have six more tickets in the next four weeks."
I read the script and liked it. I hope that I'll be able to see it live one day.
"I join you in this opinion, popularity be damned! The play was a lot of fun — good wholesome silly wizarding fun. Yeah, the plot is garbage and some of the changes to canon are downright weird. But it was like watching a Potter film for the first time again, layered on top of an actual magic show."
"Is this really an unpopular opinion? I saw it on Broadway shortly after it opened, back when it was still done in 2 parts,  and enjoyed it thoroughly."
"I like to think of it as a fun ""what if"" story in that universe"

How did the Dursleys send stuff to Harry when he was at Hogwarts?
"Hedwig who most likely pestered them until one of them gave in and gave Harry something, no chance they would send any gift otherwise."
Because it's much funnier for them to send terrible presents than no presents
My head cannon has always been that Hogwarts has an arrangement with Muggle families where they just pick up gifts for holidays and birthdays from thier homes directly
I need some help for idea in Harry Potter
"What exactly are you looking for? Harry could do anything really, to prep for the task, including the bubblehead charm, transfiguration, animangus (with enough prep time), potions, etc.

Are you just looking for ideas like that? Random ways he could have accomplished the task?"
The Cost of Murder
I think it’s murder in general
"Riddle used a Basilisk and then poison to kill Myrtle and Hepzibah smith, and that was enough to split his soul and make horcruxes. I think the intent to murder someone is all that matters."
"The soul splits from murder, whether this applies to Muggles or not is never mentioned."
"I personally do think it also applies to muggles, and that it can only be repaired by genuine remorse. Any form of murder counts. (But not necessarily any form of killing.)"
"It doesn't matter how you do it, it's the intent in cold blood that counts. Voldemort killed Myrtle using the basilisk and Hepzipah Smith poisoning her cocoa."
I think the reason for murder matters. Snape killing Dumbledore probably was not enough to make a horcrux. Method is not important but reason is in making horcruxes.
I think it’s tied to the spell a drawback if you will.
"Goblet of Fire, and the Crouch's"
"The Ministry can't detect magic from adults. Only kids who have the trace on them.

As for what prevents people from using them? The law. Yes you can use the Unforgivables and if no one finds out there is no problem on your end. But if someone does find out its straight to Azkaban."
"They're illegal, but there's nothing tracking them."
"The Unforgiveable Curses are illegal but wizards aren't omnipotent to their use. The only magic that the Ministry tracks is the trace on underage wizards, and then a loosely corollary example would be when they put a jinx on Voldemort's name.

Otherwise, the only way to uncover the use of Unforgiveable Curses is through investigative law enforcement work. You'd have to know or a suspect a curse was used, try to find who used it, and then try to prove they did it (e.g. you can see what spells a wand recently cast, so that would be one way).

As to what keeps people from using the spells, ask yourself a similar question - what stops you from shooting and killing someone, even if you knew you wouldn't get caught? Most people have a moral compass regardless of what the law says."
"There’s no tracker on the unforgivables unless they’re underage (which the Crouch’s weren’t). Even then it couldn’t be traced to the exact wizard that cast it only that it was cast in the presence someone underage.

As for what’s stopping them? They’re not simple spells. Moody says all of Harry’s class could shoot AK at him and he wouldn’t even get a nosebleed. Also they take a toll on the caster (but you’ll find out more on that in later books). Otherwise the same thing stops them as what stops (or fails to stop) people in the real world committing horrific crimes."
"If the ministry could track the use of unforgivables, they wouldn't have had so much trouble dealing with them."
"The Ministry can’t track when a wizard or witch uses an unforgiveable curse. They could determine if someone used it if they had the wizard or witch’s wand, and used priori incantatem, but that’s about it.

The fact that they’re illegal is what’s supposed to keep people from using them."
"I'm thinking they can't be tracked. When Moody/Crouch Jr. is explaining them to the class, he talks about how a lot of wizards who'd done awful things during Voldy's first rise to power tried to stay out of prison by claiming that they'd only done those things because they were Imperiused.  That was problematic, because ""How do you sort out the liars?""  If they had a way of knowing when the curse was being used, that would be easy enough to figure out.

Most of the people who cast unforgivable curses probably get away with it.

What keeps most people from using them is exactly the same thing that keeps most muggles from torturing and murdering people."
What would be a good karma curse for anyone who says Mudblood?
"A compounding loss of magic. The first time you say mudblood your spells fail for the next day. The second time you say mudblood your next two days of spells fail. The third time you say mudblood your next three days of spells fail....

It is basically karma, if you keep going on about how other people shouldn't be wizards.... suddenly you aren't one as well. You would still have your ""pureblood"" but what is the use if you literally fail every spell? 

There is a reason I shouldn't be allowed to solve real world problems."
Flipendo will do.
"Don't know why people downvote this kind of question, it's just for a laugh!

Great question in my opinion!

I liked a few of the other replies but I'd probably say a bunch of mud falls on their head out of thin air, a bit like they used get slimed at Nickelodeon 😂"
Nothing. I'd want Hermione to be an adult instead.
"They literally bleed mud. Whenever they cut themselves, mud is what comes out."
Turn their tongue into a fruit rollup.
Malfoy the amazing bouncing ferret comes to mind... that would be a good reaction to saying mudblood.. I doubt hermione would ever make something that actually harms people... this would embarrass the crap of them though 😅

"One of the most beautifully written paragraphs in the book (Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, Chapter 24 - The Wandmaker)"
Grief and love are two sides of the same coin.
Harry probably became one of the wisest Wizard of his age thanks to hands on experience he got alongwith Dumbledore's shared wisdom
But how does Harry not realize that the reason he’s grieving these people so much is because he loved them?
"My favorite part of the books really. Dobby dying wasnt just sad, it was a major turning point for Harry and the story. Sometimes when I re-read DH, I finish the story and then go back to this part and re-read the ending *again* because its so good. 

This is why, for me, Dobby's death is the saddest *and* the most impactful. It was Dobby's sacrifice that causes Harry to finally understand why Dumbledore was talking about with the power of love."
I agree!
So poignant and sadly beautiful!
"“And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.”"
"This to me represents everything that Harry Potter is about.

Harry Potter is so much more than chocolate frogs and flying broomsticks. It's about the darkness of the human condition."
"""What is grief... if not love persevering?""

-Vision (not sure which film)"
"Grief comes from love. This paragraph reminds me of the quote from WandaVision. ""What is grief, if not love persevering?"" Harry is feeling so much grief at the loss of Dobby, but knows deep down that it is love that he is feeling. That is why he states that Dumbledore would call it love. This is one of my favorite paragraphs from the entire series"
Reaction To Graveyard Confrontation In GOF
"It was naturally very disjointing/unnerving. I read it when it was first released, and I remember having to re-read the same section multiple times because Cedric is killed and Harry hoisted up for torture all in a matter of minutes. It was the darkest turn for the series up to that point IMO."
"Reading that as a kid - it was so intense, and so terrifying..."
"I was 7 and still holding a grudge that Cedric didn’t just come out and tell Harry what the second task was and stole his girl Cho so I wasn’t all that down about it 🙈 

Definitely had a much stronger reaction when it came out in cinemas. Amos Diggory’s cry was harrowing."
"Tbh the scene traumatized me as a child. I refused to continue to read for almost a whole year after Cedric perished. I only picked it up again before the movie was out. I wanted to be able to process his death so I wouldn't cry in the theater when it happened inevitably.

In the years since I grew up and for a while thought I was over Cedric's untimely demise. That is until I saw the movie again at Christmas time. I realized then I would never truly get over it. That his death would haunt me with the daggers of evil for as long as I recalled it."
I was traumatized by OOTP to be honest; not the graveyard scenes.
It has been mentioned in the books if Harry bought some decent muggle clothes
I think there was a theory that he didn’t use any of his money so that his uncle and aunt didn’t know he had it
"He would need to exchange his money at Gringotts. By the time he is diagon alley every summer he’s out of the muggle world so it doesn’t matter to him. 

Then even if he had the muggle money to go spend in clothing shops I imagine he’d have to ask the Dursley’s to drive him there. Which they wouldn’t."
"I don't think he wanted to advertise that he had any money because the Dursleys may have demanded it for keeping him. Also, he wasn't really allowed to go get his money or shop during the summer when he was with the Dursleys. He couldn't even go into Hogsmeade and buy clothing while at Hogwarts because no one signed his permission slip. So, he just had to take what he was given and deal with it. :("
"Dudley wasn’t fat by the time they were 17, he was put on a diet and took up boxing in the 4th (I think) book. Besides, I doubt Harry cared what he looked like in the muggle world really, he was just waiting to get back to the wizarding one all summer."
"this is where magic in the HP universe is really under utilized, surely magic could've tailored Harrys clothes to be perfect fitting. But this has always been my complaint about HP, how is there even poverty in the wizarding community when it seems magic could literally solve every single problem? Surely 90 percent of all the problems faced by wizards should be solved by the very thing only they have the ability to do, MAGIC!"
"It's not really mentioned but it is mentioned implicitly - like Mrs. Weasley buying him his dress robes etc., so I assume she also bought him some ""more normal"" clothes from time to time, too.

The books don't actually mention much of them wearing muggle clothes underneath the robes or in their free time though, and rarely focus on their clothing except for book seven, when Hermione stashed it for them."
"I don’t get the sense he cared enough to buy muggle clothes. I don’t think he really had the opportunity to do so the first two summers and it’s not like he spends much time doing stuff in the muggle world. I don’t think he cares if he looks bad when he is at kings cross because, most wizards can’t dress themselves well as muggles so if his clothes look bad it’s just muggleborns who’d notice. To the extent the movies are right and they wore muggle clothes underneath the robes and wore muggle stuff more regularly I imagine he bought stuff “off screen” just like potion supplies and owl food."
"Its also never mentioned that he got new glasses, so he wears the same glasses from when he was a small kid all the way till the end of the series."
"I think he just didn't have access to his money in the muggle world. All his money is in wizarding currency. He'd have to go to Gringotts to swap it to muggle currency, not something he can do easily. 

And then he's got to deal with the fallout at the Dursely's. The escalating abuse in response to him buying his own, nicer clothes wouldn't have been worth it."
"I'd like to point out that the films are wrong - robes are ROBES 

They look like dresses and cover you from neck to ankle

Most wizards wear robes, maybe with underwear beneath them (unless they're like the Scottish wizard at the World Cup who likes a breeze around his privates)

All this ""wearing normal clothes and tossing a cape with arms over the top of them"" is just the films."
"So we can all agree that the reason Sirius refused to be James and Lily’s secret keeper is because he saw himself as untrustworthy BECAUSE he had an affair with Lily, right?"
"Rita, is that you?"
"lol, no. I don’t think we can all agree on that."
"… no, there is nothing that implies this, or anything other than Sirius having been a faithful and devoted friend to James since boyhood."
"No. Sirius Black wasn’t the Secret Keeper for James and Lily Potter because he and the Potters believed it would be too obvious. They assumed that Voldemort would immediately suspect Sirius, so they devised a plan to mislead him. Instead, they chose Peter Pettigrew as the Secret Keeper, thinking no one would suspect him.

Sirius suggested this switch himself, believing that Peter would be safer and less likely to be targeted. However, this plan backfired when Pettigrew betrayed them to Voldemort. Sirius deeply regretted this decision, as it led to James and Lily’s deaths and his own wrongful imprisonment in Azkaban."
Where do yall come up with these theories…
No way. I don't think Lily or Sirius would do that to James. EVER. I think that Sirius wore his family name like a scarlet letter and there was a part of him that worried that whatever made the Black family so awful was in his DNA and he'd never truly escape it. I think he didn't trust himself due to his family being so wretched.
Im so confused. Where does this theory come from ???
please stop
Which fanfic did you read?
how dare you
Funko Pops
Neville and Ron
Is bitty pops
"Omg, so cute! Where are they from? Are they sold as figures?"
The first one kinda looks like young Newt Scamander to me. Second one is definitely Ron.
Possible Companion Books
because if she did that she might as well do a whole new HP series either a continuation or a series that relates but is all new like Harry's kids time at school or his parents time at school which would print even more money.
Beasts and Houses
"It's actually likely that the House crests were the founders' actual family crests/heraldries, but I could be wrong as it's (as far as I know) not explained in the books."
Probably just heraldry
JKR hadn't made that part up yet.
"That’s a good question. Might be because lions, badgers, eagles, and snakes are animals everyone knows. Whereas a magical/mythological creature might not be known by everyone.

I think the House crests should instead be:

Gryffindor: a Hippogriff

Slytherin: a Basilisk

Ravenclaw: a Phoenix

Hufflepuff: Unicorn"
"Before i saw the pictures of the crests/read the books/watched the films and such, young me seriously thought gryffindor house had something to do with Griffins"
"In 10th century britain, lions were not exactly common animals."
Harry Potter: The Ultimate Epic Fanfiction | Part 1
"Pureblood, halfblood, mudblood - what's the cutoff?"
"The only reason Harry is considered wizard royalty is the fact that he is the “Chosen One”, the one that will and has fulfilled the prophecy of beating the Dark Arts. Even though he’s half-blood he gets that respect cause it was for-told. 
Voldemort is also a great example of how power overcomes muggle parentage. Everyone fears him but he is still being worshipped by pure-bloods even being a half-blood himself."
I think it only really affects muggleborns. Once you have a wizard for a parent you’re fine.
Snape was the child of a pure blood and a muggle.
"True Purebloods have no Muggle Ancestry. 

Purebloods that aren’t part of the Sacred 28 have no Muggle Parents or Grandparents. 

Halfbloods have Muggle Parents or Grandparents. 

Muggleborns have muggle ancestry and a new bloodline started with the Muggleborn. 

All this means nothing except artificial classism. Trying to impose that some are better because of bloodlines and such, when clearly the Gaunts were worse off than most and inbred due to their pureblood supremacy. 

So basically… it doesn’t matter. It comes down to Witches and Wizards or Muggles. You’re one or the other."
"There isn't a hard and fast ruleset. That's the thing about all blood purity nonsense - it's completely arbitrary. It's not supposed to make sense, because classism never does."
Re-reading Harry Potter as an adult hits completely differently.
"Molly and Arthur had the life. ... Okay maybe I'm not fond of that many kids. But owned their home, filled it with love, and had a community around them (magical and not)?"
"No tuition fees but you still get rubbish hand-me-downs.

“I hate being poor.”"
The kids do still have to buy their own books though and we can see the financial strain this has on the Weasleys when Harry was staying with them in CoS. Same for wands
Reading it since I had my own kid makes me so sad for baby Harry. He was only a year old when he went to live with the Dursleys and he was so loved before that. I just kept imagining my son seeking out love/attention/affection and getting locked in a cupboard and starved instead 😭😭
"I cried my eyes out at the St Mungos candy scene listening to it on audiobook last week. I thought it was sweet as a kid, as an adult it devastated me."
"Re-reading them as an adult childhood trauma sufferer I wonder why Harry Potter gets to be a successful hero with friends and money and my broke ass is too anxious to talk to people or work.
I mean if you stayed  over 10 years in a family that treats you that poorly you'd be so much more messed up than Harry is. To me the magic starts when he doesn't have crippling mental health issues.


But yeah the magical world still gives me comfort. "
"Yes, now I'm terribly jealous that wizards can treat their teeth with magic and maybe even clean it the same way! And also clean the room in seconds and fix things with a wave of a magic wand."
Re-reading it as a parent is brutal.
I never read the books as a kid but I’m reading them now at age 22 and id agree. I would’ve never have appreciated this as a kid
"With whats going on in the USA right now, rereading and rewarching HP rings another bell. If ya know what I mean. "
"Latest updates in Hogwarts by LukeGki project - new Grounds Map, Google Earth, 3D Print"
"The Whomping Willow is just crazily placed compared to The Shrieking Shack. I don't mean this as a slight on the map-maker, I think this is what it needs to be like, but that distance is absolutely huge, and would need to go so far down given how deep the lake is for the Triwizard Tournament."
Source: [Hogwarts by LukeGki](https://hogwartslukegki.wordpress.com/)
How does the lake work geographically? Does it not have an inflow and an outflow? Is it fed by a glacier?
ooooooo cool!
I made (minimalistic) The Monster Book of Monsters petit fours!
"Petit fours are usually covered in poured fondant (which is what I used), which is why they don't look ""furry"". I also planned to give them teeth, but didn't realise I was out of regular fondant until I had begun making them."
"Ooooh, this is really appetizing. 🤤📚🍫 Congrats!"
"I wouldn't want to eat them, they're so cute!"
Might have to bite them before they bite me!
these look so good!!! they almost look too good to eat :)
"So, I noticed something in HBP"
"I think it's because earlier in the book Lavender laughed at something Ron said and then, at quidditch trials she smiled and wished him luck.

I don't think he actually liked her, but for once there's a girl noticing him instead of Harry, and he likes the attention"
"It wasn’t blatantly stated, but yeah she left subtle hints like this about it leading up to their relationship. 

I’m not quite sure it was true feelings though. More something like Ron had hormones, was lonely and embarrassed never having snogged a girl, and Lavender was attractive and available."
"I don't know if he was crushing on her, but she was crushing on him and dropping hints, and I think that's what made Ron notice her."
"yes, and her him"
She was attractive and he was a teen. That was all his feelings were. They weren't deep enough to get called a crush. He was in love with Hermione at that point
"Lavender and Ron definitely had some mutual interest going on in HBP, but Ron doesn't really seem to notice his girl classmates until it's too late (see, Hermione, Yule Ball)."
"I refuse to believe Ron didn’t like/wasn’t attracted to Lavender. It wasn’t true love and it wasn’t stronger than his feelings for Hermione, but there’s no reason to believe he wasn’t into her on some level. It wasn’t that deep and it faded fast.

I think the discourse comes from people who can’t fathom that people can like more than one person at once. Im not one of those people—I like one person and one person alone—but I know plenty of people who always had several interests at any point and time. They had like ranked crushes—one being the best and others being less so. But they’ll take attention from any of them. Granted if their number one came along, they’d drop the others in a heartbeat; if they didn’t, they enjoyed the other people.

This is how I see Ron. Hermione was his number one, but she wasn’t reciprocating in the way he wanted/needed. Lavender was, so he enjoyed it while it lasted."
"Yeah, he was. Did you catch the Uranus joke in OotP?"
are we all forgetting when he asked to see her anus in 3rd year? 😂
I mean I think he did like lavender at some point but it just frizzled out near the end.
Magic outside od school
He was not going school yet at that point so they would know it was accidentally done magic by a kid
"Potentially the fact that the glass disapearing was something Harry didn't mean to do, it just happened when he was angry. When he first meets Hagrid, he is asked if he's ever made anything unexplained happen without meaning to. The glass, being up on the roof when outrunning bullies and his hair growing back are all examples of this. The fact that they are all unintentional is probably why the Ministry didn't pick up on them.

The floating cake is a deliberate use of magic by Dobby that was planned, and a spell of some sort was thought about and cast. Harry takes the blame because it happens at his address and he is the only wizard there.

  
EDIT after seeing your reply to the other comment: How this fits with Aunt Marge blowing up I am not sure. Perhaps because that happened *after* he found out he was a wizard and had already spent two years at Hogwarts and had been warned about magic use in the muggle world, they were ready to hold Harry accountable, even for accidental use of magic."
"The glass disappearing at the zoo most likely would be considered accidental magic by a young child in both lacking any education or understand of the laws of the wizarding world which we are told is a fairly common occurrence for young wizard and witch children especially when emotions run high in the child or they panic and get scared. Harry at this time would still fall in this category for use of magic and this wouldn't be the first time for Harry, he magically regrew his hair after and awful haircut, shrunk and ugly sweater that Petunia tried to force him into and magically found himself on the roof of his primary school while running away from Dudley and the rest of his gang.

After attending school there is now the expectation that the children should have both enough control of their magic to not create the same accidental magic like they did before and an understanding of the law to not deliberately cast magic. So when they detected the hover charm used near Harry and knowing Harry is the only wizard nearby and not detecting Dobby the ministry assumes its Harry breaking the law with knowledge that he shouldn't be casting magic but he is still a young child hence the written warning.

In Prisoner of Azkaban with Sirus Black escaped and at this time assumed to be a dangerous support of Voldemort out the kill Harry his use of magic to inflate Aunt Marge is overlooked as Harry is famous and well liked by a the populace and ministry so best to sweep it under the rug and move on so as to make protecting Harry easier. 

Then Order of the Pheonix he cast the Patrouns charm but now the Ministry is against him because Fudge can't accept the return of Voldemort and is out to discredit Harry by any means possible and has just been handed a use of magic by an underage wizard hence the full trial"
"Before kids get their wand and start being taught, their magic is almost entirely uncontrollable.  They aren't charged when that happens.  Once they begin consciously directing their power, accidental magic becomes much less common, and so they're held more responsible for its use outside of school.  The Hover charm placed on the cake was clearly deliberate, and so he got a warning for it."
"Something that bothers me about the legality of Harry's magic is the fact that in PoA Fudge himself comes to tell him he's not convicted, yet not even two years later he gets sent to court for self-defense. It just confuses me man"
Would you have enjoyed History of Magic class if you went to Hogwarts?
"I like history, and I can imagine magical history would have been extremely fascinating, but not the way Binns taught it"
I think the subject isn’t the problem but how Binns taught it. As Harry mentioned that he could make something so interesting sound so boring
"I don’t think so. I think the thing that made it so much worse is that Binns didn’t make any effort to actually teach the material; he just droned on. There were also reports that he didn’t even stop or start his lessons; he just at some point walked away or came into the classroom in the middle of thoughts, so he was also hard to follow. I think the only people really successful in his class were people like Hermione who did a lot of research and studying outside of it."
"To summarize most of the comments:

History of Magic ✅

Taught by Binns ❌"
"I've taken subjects I hated, but were required that I liked because of the professor, and subjects I thought I would have loved, that I hated because of the professor. 

For History of Magic, the idea of it is fascinating. But, if I had to sit through one of Binns classes, I'd probably feel the same way Harry does. I'd just read the book and then go to the library to research anything I'm interested in."
"I would have loved reading about history, and would have Bern bored by the class.  A dull teacher can suck the life out of the most interesting subjects."
"I never enjoyed history. At all. Oh i found some of the highlights interesting. But not the minutia that the teacher would require for the tests.

Please write a 5 page detailed analysis of the war of jenkins ear. Ugh, kill me now."
Absolutely.
"Yes, if it isn't Binns. Even Harry says the subject could be awesome but...Binns is just so extremely boring that he makes it boring."
"I think that, it would have just been another class for us, because they way they describe it(textbooks, notes, lexures), it just sounds like a normal muggle class."
"Can someone please describe, nutshell, compare and contrast the different sensory experiences between apparating, flooing, and portkeying? And which is worse on the body, in your opinion?"
"Apparition: Poof and sometimes AAAAAAARRRRGHHH

Floo: Whoosh

Portkey: WeeEeEeeEEEEEE…blergh"
"I think when perfected, apparating would be the least bothersome. I always pictured it as taking your body and transferring it to another place, almost instantaneously, whereas the other two would feel like you are using a third party object to ***drag*** yourself to another location, so the feeling described in the books is one of being uncomfortably pulled to another place.

Floo powder would be the worst sensory experience because you can hear and see snippets of other fireplaces as you whiz past if I remember, you can get soot in your mouth, you have flames licking at you even if you can't feel it which would be odd, you are spinning around and can come out the other end in a heap, not to mention coming out dusty."
"Floo powder has you travel through a massive network of interconnected fireplaces and you sense the entire process. You pass through the actual fireplaces between you and your destination, you can physically hit things on the way, get ash in your mouth, touch actual flames, and if you fidget or panic or get jostled you can emerge from the wrong fireplace somewhere along your path. The spinning sensation can't be fun either. It's also described as slower than apparating, but it's definitely easier mechanically than the other two methods.

Portkeys, well... here's an actual quote from the official wiki: ""Traveling by Portkey was said to feel like having a hook ""somewhere behind the navel"" pulling the traveler to their location.The sensation of traveling by Portkey was universally agreed to be uncomfortable, if not downright unpleasant, and could lead to nausea, giddiness, or worse."" It's quick, almost instantaneous, but there is such a thing as portkey-sickness kinda like seasickness. But this method also seems to be the most versatile, you can set up a portkey to take you literally anywhere in the world, unlike Floo powder which requires connecting a fireplace to a system which limits where you can go, and unlike apparition which seems to have a distance limit.

Here's the quote about Harry's sensation when he apparates for the first time: ""... the next thing he knew everything went black; he was pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull, and then—"" In short, very unpleasant, but also it only lasts a flash, and you probably get used to it. But splinching can be severe, even deadly if you lose a significant chunk of yourself. If you're really really good at it, it's probably no trouble, but you do need a lot of skill here."
"I figure a simple comparison would be Harry's first experience of each:

Apparating:
>the next thing he knew, everything went black; he
was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not
breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eye-
balls were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being
pushed deeper into his skull.

Floo Powder:
>It felt as though he were being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed to be spinning very fast — the roaring in his ears was deafening — he tried
to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick —
something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still
spinning and spinning — now it felt as though cold hands were slapping
his face — squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of
fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond — his bacon
sandwiches were churning inside him — he closed his eyes again wishing
it would stop

Portkey:
>It happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just be-
hind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward. His
feet left the ground; he could feel Ron and Hermione on either side
of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding for-
ward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was stuck
to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward

I think Apparating sounds the worst whilst Portkey sounds pretty reasonable."
"I know this is gonna get me downvoted but it’s fiction… so no… we can’t describe how it feels.

But you can do what everyone else does and just use your imagination and guess

There’s no “right” answer. We’re just doing what everyone else does when we read any kind of fiction and we’re just imagining based on the words that were chosen to describe it"
"Well Apparation i imagine is like going extremely fast in a car then stopping 

floo powder is whirling around fast then it shoots you out 

and portkey is like rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr then your there"
Why did Mad eye Moody wait till the end of triwizard tournament to teleport harry using the port key? Why couldn't he just have converted a random object to a port key and made harry touch it?
"Voldemort wanted to come back in secret. Having Harry just disappear would arouse suspicion. 

The plan was to make it look like Harry had died in the maze, and no one would have been any the wiser about what happened in the Graveyard."
Its all about style and being dramatic 😅
"Also is it actually possible to use a port key from within the castle? Pretty sure Dumbledore had set up protective enchantments to prevent that... the end of the third task was when Harry was meant to be alone, away from Dumbledore's eyes in the maze"
"I don’t think it is normally possible to portkey in or out of Hogwarts. Dumbledore would have to lower the magical protections on the area where the portkey is. Which I assume he did in his office that those times. 

What I suspect happened was that they wanted the Triwizard Cup to transport the champion to the front of the maze to show the winner. So they had to lower the magical protections for that to happen. However Moody (Barty jr) added a second portkey spell on the cup so Harry would be transported to the graveyard. So basically Harry was super lucky that the original portkey spell was added to the cup and allowed him to escape."
"I think it’s because it was when Harry would be most isolated.  

During the First Task, everyone was watching him. 

During the Second Task, the merfolk were watching him. 

During the Third Task, he was essentially alone. If his dead body turned up in the maze, being sent back by Voldemort, the Wizarding World would assume that one of the challenges in the maze had killed him accidentally.  Given the nature of the tournament and it’s history, they probably wouldn’t have investigated it more, and Voldemort’s return would have gone completely unnoticed. 

If Harry had been taken at any point earlier, people would have noticed, especially since the Daily Prophet had been covering his every move for months and the international wizard community were all following the tournament."
"This is a common question. Two key points to remember: 

One, Voldemort wanted to return without Dumbledore and the Order finding out. If Harry had walked into Professor Moody’s office one day and never come back, everyone would suspect foul play. The fake Moody would immediately be suspected and interrogated, and Dumbledore would find out Voldemort was back. This is what actually ends up happening when Harry ultimately ends up surviving anyway. If Harry had died during one of the Tasks, however, there was a chance his death would have just been written off as an accident, and Voldemort could have returned in secret with a spy in Dumbledore’s inner circle. 

Two, Voldemort is a drama queen. "
"Two main reasons as far as I can tell. Number 1, Harry's disappearance and (planned) death were supposed to be covert, so as not to alert Dumbledore. Imagine the uproar that would spring up if Harry walked into Moody's office one day and never walked out. Imagine how much suspicion would fall on Barty, it would collapse the subterfuge. And number 2, I imagine that potion they used to re-flesh Voldemort probably took significant time to prepare, no?"
Time. Voldemort needed time to do his deed.
"Apparating  in and out of Hogwarts is not possible so I assume making a portkey would be as well, although I don’t remember if this is explicitly said in the books. In the sixth book Dumbledore and Harry need to apparate from Hogsmeade to go to the cave so even Dumbledore can’t change that. The maze is outside the castle so maybe that area doesn’t have the same protections or perhaps the cup was always meant to be a portkey and Moody changed the route when he placed it in the maze."
To let Voldemort come back in secret. An investigation would have revealed his return.
Searching for a Ronald Weasley fanfic
"Well, I haven’t heard of a fanfic like this, but you could always make one yourself 🙂"
Have you tried r/HPfanfiction ?
Have you read Harry Potter and the half blood prince
DADA Curse?
"https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Muggle_Studies
He previously taught Muggle Studies."
"> ""Snape's been after Quirrells job for years""

Doesn't mean Quirrell has had the DADA job for years, merely referencing the DADA job through Quirrell with a bit of misdirection - in a way, it sets up the reader to ask why so many different DADA teachers? With the pay off in book 6. But none of it was untrue, just easily misinterpretted."
"I always assumed that the original intend was to have Squirrel as that dada teacher, who has already done it for some time but JKR came up with the idea of the course later and just went with it. 

Book one clearly reads as if Quirrel was the dada teacher for at least one year before. That also aligns with how Hagrid introduces him to Harry."
Pretty sure the J.K.Rowling didn't get the idea for the DADA curse until later on. So she later retconned it that Quirrell used to be the Muggle studies teacher before he took a sabbatical and then became the DADA teacher for Harry's first year
"I’d imagine the curse was invented by JK later & she’s just lucky she never explicitly said that Quirrell has had the job for years. Your examples imply she didn’t preplan it, but there’s just enough wiggle room that I think the canon still works. 

You can imagine getting a job at a new firm and a new coworker saying, “Watch out for Sandra, she’s been after your job for years!”. I think JK gets away with this one but I agree that it looks like her initial intention wasn’t the one every year."
