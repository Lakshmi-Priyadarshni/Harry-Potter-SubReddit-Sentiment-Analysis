"18 years ago today, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were announced as the lead actors in Harry Potter. - On 23 August 2000, Daniel Radcliffe (11), Rupert Grint (11) and Emma Watson (10) attended a press conference to be introduced as the lead actors in the Harry Potter film series. [Here's an adorable photo of them that day.](https://i.imgur.com/aCkiE5X.jpg)

Daniel was discovered by a producer seated in front of him in a theatre. He had previously been in a TV series. Rupert and Emma were selected from thousands of auditioning children. Their only previous acting experience were school plays.

One year later, the first movie was released, of what would become one of the highest-grossing film series of all time. [Cute clip of the press conference that day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDFkJrusu7E)",2018-08-23 12:10:35,19950,104,0.802,"In an interview Daniel Radcliffe told J.K. Rowling about the time he got dicovered. He was in the theatre and the produced just kept turning around and staring at him and making Daniel and his parents reallly uncomfortable. They even considered leaving the theatre during the break but Daniel really liked the show so they decided to stay and the rest is history

EDIT: added the link to the interview  Imagine casting this movie with children, knowing you have to project them through a decade of movies during such a transformative portion of a persons life. That's gotta be tough.   I don’t think my life and my character as a person would be the same without the series, both the books and movies. 

It’s just incredible to think how one person and her ideas has shaped countless children around the world into who they are today.   18 years ago today was the first day of my crush on Emma Watson. Thought she was so cute.

I was her age, to be clear...  It’s insane how lucky they got with the casting. It’s hell to find one good child actor, but they managed to land three.  “18 years ago... How are they in their late 20s already?!” - me, 26.  As my 18 birthday was a few weeks ago, this reminds me how my life has always revolved around HP. Damn how time has passed  If they had just waited a week for 1 September then they could have pulled off a sorting hat reveal or something similar  As a child, I remember when all three were announced only recognising Daniel Radcliffe who had played David Copperfield in a mini series a year prior.   Damn they're old. And so am I. What is happening...this isn't what was supposed to happen"
"AITA for reporting that my friend was gifted a Firebolt anonymously? - My [F14] friend [M13] is Seeker for our House Qudditch team. He's really good, but recently his broomstick got broken, and he's stuck practicing on the old school broomsticks.

Then, out of nowhere, he was gifted a *Firebolt* at Christmas. But there was no note. Someone bought him the most expensive broomstick on the market but didn't want him to know who it was from.

Naturally, I thought this would be suspicious for anyone, but on top of that, there's reason to believe that my friend is being targeted by a dangerous criminal. So I told our Head of House about the Firebolt and she confiscated it in case it had been cursed.

Now my friend has stopped speaking to me and I don't know what to do. My other best friend [M13] isn't speaking to me either because apparently to *boys* winning a Quidditch match is more important than not dying.

AITA for getting my friend's broomstick confiscated because I was worried about his safety?",2020-08-28 13:26:33,17494,260,0.9111,"Info: what does your cat think about this situation? Does he know/trust the sender?  YTA

You just cost Gryffindor the House Cup!

-keeperwood22  ESH. You should have told him first of your suspicions before going to your Head of House. That said they shouldn't be ignoring you. Think both you and your friends should apologise.  Merlin with these people on the *Quibbler*, this is obviously bait; do people really believe that this happens? Next up 'AITA for casting Sectumsempra in self defense on a crying boy because he attempted to cast the Cruciatus Curse on me?'  NTA

Potter doesn't deserve a better broomstick than me

*comment left by NotDracoMalfoy*  INFO

Have there recently been any highly Publicized jailbreaks?  Maybe any mass murderers spotted in the area?  Is your friend, by any chance, wanted dead by the supporters of a tyrannical evil overlord?  These kinds of things would make a difference in this situation   ESH. 

You're working based on conjecture, and the boys should have talked to you instead of outright not talking to you. Massive communication breakdown here.  You should cut all ties with them. Do not be afraid to cut out the toxic people from your life.

You're in the right here and your two ''friends'' should understand. If they don't then cut ties, no compromise. Because that's how human relationships work. You cut people out if they make a single mistake. I learned this as a fact on various subredditsso it must be true. 

You might have saved his life and all he cares about is quiditch. Try talking to your house's head girl and maybe ask her to make sure that they can't bother you in the common room. Or send an owl to the Ministry to send someone to talk to them if the professors won't help you in cutting them out of your life. Think about sueing if nothing else helps.  YTA. 

Stay away from my godson.

How could you take away such a cool broomstick?? You sound like a stuck up nerd. I bet you would also ""teach"" people how to say incantations and perform spells. I could never get along with such a dork.

"Arthur's surprisingly large influence in the Ministry low-key symbolizes the theme of the series. - At first glance, Arthur appears to be a pretty meaningless cog in the Ministry machine.

His job doesn't pay him that well, and the department he heads, officially, isn't very powerful. Quite the contrary, his job is seen as kind of a joke. Nobody really cares about his department, it's mentioned that it's literally just him and one other guy.

And yet, despite that, Arthur seems surprisingly well-connected. He's able to score the best possible seats money can buy to the Quidditch World Cup, he's able to push through his Muggle Protection Act despite being deeply unpopular with the rich and powerful, and several times mentions ""pulling strings"" or calling in favors within the Ministry throughout the series.

And again, his department is seen as a joke, so it's not like he's well connected because his position is powerful, it's the opposite, his position only has what little power it does because Arthur is well-connected.

And the actual reason as far as I can tell why he has so much pull is that ***people simply like him.*** They help him out because he's *nice.* Ludo Bagman gets him those perfects seats because Arthur had helped him previously, and all the Ministry employees (even Crouch) seem genuinely friendly with Arthur because he's earnestly, enthusiastically pleasant to every single person he meets. Arthur Weasley is revealed to be a much richer man than he first appears, but his wealth is in reputation in stead of gold.

And that's kind of the main theme of the entire series, isn't it? That true power is one's ability to connect with other people, to be *kind* to people, and being the kind of person that people want to help. It's a less extreme version of exactly what enables Harry to be the hero and win in the end.",2020-08-14 11:26:38,14863,135,0.9929,"Additionally, look at the Weasley children:

* Curse breaker married to a beautiful and talented witch. Was Head Boy at Hogwarts.
* Dragon tamer and legendary Seeker.
* Ministry official at a very young age. Was Head Boy at Hogwarts.
* Wildly successful business owners at a young age with keen magical abilities to create their products. Also great Quidditch players.
* Auror who was instrumental in the defeat of Voldemort, married to the Minister of Magic. 
* Professional Quidditch player and extremely skilled witch who marries an Auror.


Like the Weasleys should be writing books on how to raise successful children. They clearly are extremely smart and also quite athletic and all extremely brave considering every single one of them showed up for The Battle of Hogwarts, and one of them died. Arthur’s connections through his children alone would outpace any other Wizard of his day.

Ron was made out to be some kind of dummy, yet he got OWLs in every subject except History of Magic and Divination, was one of only 12 students in his year to take NEWT potions, and was some sort of chess prodigy as well. And the least academically gifted of his children are able to create patented daydreams, love potions, and shield clothing that are so advanced they essentially become defense contractors for the Ministry of Magic.

Oh and let’s not forget that Arthur’s wife personally defeated Voldemort’s second in command in a duel. Just another day for the Weasleys.  I was so annoyed that the GoF movie had them in shitty seats  I never thought of it that way but you’re right. Arthur’s able to achieve almost everything Lucius is capable of achieving with money, brown-nosing and threats with just being a good guy. Best exemplified with the World Cup. Lucius must have been pissed to find out the box wasn’t quite as exclusive as he thought it was.  This whole post can be summed up by movie Arthur:

 ""We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.""  This is an excellent way to look at things  >all the Ministry employees (even Crouch) seem genuinely friendly with Arthur

This also makes the running gag where Crouch keeps calling Percy ""Weatherby"" not really make sense.

Like, does he think that Arthur is *also* named Weatherby?  I honestly don't think that he earns so little. He's able to single-handedly feed 9 mouths after all, and his family frequently hosts guests (for example Harry, Hermione and Fleur) for weeks on end. Having 7 kids is expensive and if they only had one or two (like most \[wizard\] families I'm sure they'd be living quite comfortably.

I agree with you though that social currency (knowing the right kind of people) is important, even in our the muggle world.  I love this! I think Arthur is a really selfless person, and always willing to help others when they need it. And I'm sure the people he helps out are grateful and feel like they owe him a favor. It's a great example of kindness and selflessness being contagious. So wholesome.

Have a !redditGalleon for this great post  [removed]  I love Arthur Weasley. He’s one of my favourites, and he’s just such a great guy. Harry and Ginny totally dropped the ball not naming a kid after him."
"Both Harry and Sirius saw each other as a substitute for James. - I read this somewhere, and it has me rethinking their entire relationship now",2024-10-14 04:32:11,16234,52,0.0,"Maybe not a substitute, but a link. This is a good observation!  I'm gonna disagree because I remember Harry's perspective on Sirius in the books was very much like his surrogate father/older brother, I don't think Sirius reminded him of James, personality-wise. I think Harry felt closer to James because of all the stories Sirius and Lupin had about him.
Harry always saw Sirius as an adult he could trust and a family member.  Not for James per se, but, you know, Sirius is Harry's godfather, substitute parent in case the parents die is the job description.  I thought it was uber depressing james, sirius, remus, and even kind of snape had to die. like harry couldn't get one father figure or someone from that generation to remain alive and share memories about his parents.  More like the only real Family they still had  This is the scene where Harry confesses that he has dreams from Voldemorts point of view and its making him feel as angry and evil as the dark lord is. Sirus comforts him by saying; ""Good people and death eaters. We all have light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on.""

One of best lines ever written imo and its not even in the books.  Nah. The movies might have some fan-fic style nonsense like this, but in canon they were very clear about the identity of each other, and while there was a connection to James for both, it was a far cry from straight-up replacement/substitution.  Disagree, Harry never saw Sirius as James, only as family. 

Also don't think Sirius saw Harry as James, I think he was mostly frustrated and unable to cope with the situation which required him both to act as a parent and at the same time to do nothing and stay inside, which is why book 4 Sirius seems much more normal in comparison, even if he's eating rats

Curiously both Sirius, Lupin and Snape compare Harry to James, often with an intent to somehow manipulate him, considering Harry deep affection for his father and his sense of masculinity.  Lots of people disagreeing and while I will say it is a stretch for Harry to view Sirius as a substitute for James (I would say it's the first time he has ever had a likeable father figure though, so there are obviously elements of viewing him as the father he never had, if that's what OP is refering to) I will say that yes Sirius very much is using Harry as something of a substitute for his Best friend. I'm currently re-reading book 5 for the first time in years and I've really picked up on this theme.

Sirius was a young adult when James died and he was sent to Azkaban. 13 years later after going somewhat mad, he breaks out. 13 years of no growth, no external stimulus and the only thing that keeps him sane is knowing that he was innocent. He probably spent more time over those 13 years thinking about James than anything else. He gets out and finds the spitting image of his fixation of 13 years. The boy is also brave, a little reckless, not quite a big a bully as his dad but still. 

Of course Harry is a substitute for James to sirius. Sirius has the maturity of a teenager and has likely not been able to even process his best friend's death. Rereading the book (to my daughter now and she is loving them) and Sirius is a very different character from when I first read it as a teenager. But that's true for all the adult characters. I'm intrigued to see what I make of Dumbledore.

Damn good books, aren't they?  ""nice one James!""

"Daniel Radcliffe’s acting during the ‘Harry on Felix Felicis’ scene is one of the highlights of the film series - Daniel Radcliffe absolutely nails it- he perfectly grasps the “I’ve had a drink and I’m feeling confident vibe.” It’s such a nice way of elevating the tone of the film and overall it’s nice to see a change from the angsty angers Harry.

Really great scene in my opinion.",2020-06-06 10:25:09,12753,123,0.9392,"“Harry!”


“*Sir!*”  This gets mentioned a lot, and I have a theory as to why. Dan is a great actor in all genres I've seen him in, especially as he gets older and gains experience. But I think NATURALLY he's best at comedic acting. He is damn funny, and 99% of the hp movies aren't comedies. But the parts that are... Dan makes them gold.  ""how did you get out of the castle?""

""through the front door, sir.""  Breaking news! Felix Felicis was actually just tequila. Love it.  I always wondered whether he was possibly a bit buzzed in preparation for that scene.  If you’ve ever seen an interview with him, he basically speaks as though he’s always on Felix Felicis. I feel like that is the one scene where he’s just not acting and is instead being himself  > I’ve had a drink and I’m feeling confident 

To be fair, he seems more high than drunk. It's indeed a very funny scene, and for all the defects the HBP film has, it did manage to show the more light-hearted aspects of Harry, which the films tended to avoid.  Daniel Radcliffe hated his performance in that movie  ""HI!""  This scene almost made up for the atrocious scenes like Ginny tying Harry's shoes, the Burrow on fire etc."

Does anybody else remember how much Christians HATED Harry Potter and treated it like some demonic text? - None of my potterhead friends seem to remember this and I never see it mentioned in online fan groups. I need confirmation whether this was something that only happened in a couple churches or if it was a bigger phenomenon,2021-07-06 05:07:02,25578,126,0.2422,"My aunt is a Baptist, and she once told me she was against Harry Potter because of its depiction of witchcraft. It’s definitely a real thing. 

The really weird part is that she’s a former librarian. It blew my mind that she was so against a series that actually got kids excited about reading.  I can’t remember if it was a joke or something, but somebody’s made a Christian version of Harry Potter. Like instead of the kids using magic it was them praying to the lord and the power of god doing all the work.  It was definitely a thing.  I experienced this. My Mom thought they were demonic books about witchcraft. Once I brought it home and got her to read it she was fine with it. I’m sure she probably heard it at church.  There was a book written by Richard Abanes called Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick.  My parents picked up the book but realized pretty quickly that it was garbage.  

I’d say this was one of the last efforts to revitalize the Satanic Panic of the 80s.  It (mostly) failed and we’ve never really returned to that era since.  Absolutely! HP came out when I was in 1st grade. My teacher would read us a chapter a day, and during that time students whose parents didn't want their child exposed to witchcraft had to leave the room. 

My mom made no sense whatsoever because she let me read the books, but I wasn't allowed to watch the movies. I watched them anyways at my bestfriend's house lol. It always seemed a bit ridiculous to me to deny a child the respite books can bring.  It was a big thing in certain churches, for sure.  My grandma thought they were evil, and there was even a Chick tract about Harry Potter.

But I also worked in a bookstore for a year after high school and when HBP got released, I remember being given the stink eye by my church peers for “selling a work of Satan”. 

In 2007, when DH came out, I attended university a few towns over and like many of you, went to the midnight launch to get my copy. By then I wasn’t involved in church as much and was REALLY excited to see how the series would end. I even dresses up for the occasion.

Then, lo and behold: there are my former church peers, all at the launch. What joy to see that they had turned around on their whole Harry Potter witchcraft crap. 

But I was wrong. It was a a prayer vigil. They said the only thing they would be reading, is is the Bible. 

So yeah, the whole Harry Potter being Satanic thing was very real.

Edit: typo  I didn’t get into Harry Potter till this year because when I was a kid my mom wouldn’t let me because it supported “witchery”.

"Fans who hate Dumbledore for “raising Harry like a pig for slaughter” are forgetting something - We are seeing that conversation in Snape’s memory, and Dumbledore simply did not tell Snape the full story. He never told anyone the whole story until he told it to Harry in the King’s Cross chapter. 

From the end of GoF, Dumbledore knew, or rather, he was extremely confident that Harry could no longer die by Voldemort’s hand. That is what the look of triumph in his eyes was when Harry told him about the blood Voldemort took from him. From that moment on, Dumbledore was trying to orchestrate a situation that would lead to Voldemort’s downfall with the least amount of sacrifice necessary. And he knew that in order to do that, Harry would need to sacrifice himself willingly. Not be told to die for others, but choose to of his own free will. 

Dumbledore could have had other very trustworthy people destroy the horcruxes. He had an entire group of highly devoted and skilled wizards at his disposal. But he needed it to be Harry - he needed Harry to see and fully understand what a perversion it was to seek immortality. Dumbledore leading the trio to the Deathly Hallows was also never meant to shield Harry from death - he was already protected. The Hallows were just meant to push Harry towards the inevitable conclusion: that the mastery of death is really the acceptance of death. If Harry understood this message, the choice would come naturally to him. 

He knew Harry couldn’t die. But if Harry thought he could, and chose to, the sacrifice magic would shield everyone in the second leg of the Battle, preventing many more casualties. The final thing to do was not to fight Voldemort with skill and power, but with the one thing he never understood, but which Harry had in spades: love for others.

That’s why he never told Snape, he wanted Harry to receive only partial information. He didn’t care if that made him a villain in Snape’s eyes, as long as it led to Harry choosing to die willingly. It was the ultimate “greater good”, but so very different from how Grindelwald used the term. Dumbledore sacrificed everything, including his life, but he won, as everything worked out as he thought or even better than he thought it would.

I am sorry if this was discussed before, but I am seeing a lot of mindless hate for Dumbledore based off that quote. It seems to have become almost a default opinion in the fandom that Dumbledore was cruel and uncaring for orchestrating Harry’s death. That he didn’t give him a choice (when in fact Harry’s choice was the instrumental part). 

Dumbledore was flawed. He spent his whole life hiding from power, regretting what he did as a young man. But he was the furthest thing from cruel.",2020-04-09 13:11:39,12153,179,-0.9893,"This was a beautiful summation.  Can I just say that these are the kind of posts I like to see? I never fully understood why the Deathly Hallows were a thing in the last book.  These posts where they cause me to think about the books in a different and new way are the best ones.  

Great post!  I agree that Harry needed to know that he had to die, even if Dumbledore knew that he wouldn't. Nonetheless if Harry had to die, I'm sure Dumbledore would have arranged things so that he would die. That said, Dumbledore isn't some sociopathic Machiavellian puppetmaster playing with people like pawns on a chessboard. If Dumbledore ever sent someone to their death he'd do it with an incredibly heavy heart and he'd be convinced that the alternative was far worse. Dumbledore's gleam of triumph in GoF isn't accidental. The fact that Harry doesn't need to die, is a huge victory for him. He's genuinely happy and relieved that Voldemort can lose without Harry needing to die.

Dumbledore's only concern was to defeat Voldemort. He never would have killed someone for his own power. He was a man who was forced to make difficult choices, and could have been forced to make perhaps the hardest choice yet, if Harry had to die.  I get really tired of the Dumbledore hate train. Thank you for posting this, I think it's a great explanation. Have a !redditGalleon  I love this post OP. I just want to focus in on the Dumbledore aspect, and his mindset in manipulating Harry.

It's made explicitly clear that Dumbledore was willing to do many things for the Greater Good. Albus did not know Harry would survive until Goblet of Fire. Even still, he moved Harry like a chess piece toward his endgame, where Harry would die but so would Voldemort.

Is it good that Dumbeldore molded Harry as soon as he got his hands on him? No, it's horrifying. Snape was right in his reaction, almost nothing he has done is as sinister as this. 

Was it necessary, and artfully done? Hell yes.

Think about this. Dumbeldore had more than one reason to leave Harry out of the Wizarding World. Essentially, Dumbeldore recieved Harry as an unmolded lump of clay. Harry saw a father figure in Albus, and Dumbeldore used his every opportunity to shape Harry into the sword he needed.

>""Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,"" said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, ""Dumbledore's man through and through, aren't you, Potter?""

Scrimgeor saying things like this and that Harry is ""Dumbeldore's man through and through"" is more than him just being an asshole. Rowling wants us to know that, yes, Harry is--and it might not be as healthy as we presume. Snape realizes that Dumbledore was taking advantage of Harry's love for the old man, and when Harry tells Dumbledore that he is Dumbeldore's man,

>Dumbledore's bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.

>""I am very touched, Harry.""

The man is clearly wracked with love for the boy and shame at what he's doing.

Harry's arc in Deathly Hallows is just realizing the extent of Dumbeldore's manipulations, and how far he'd go to beat Voldemort. This quote becomes doubly heartbreaking:

>""He loved you,"" Hermione whispered. ""I know he loved you.""

>Harry dropped his arms.

>""I don't know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn't love, the mess he's left me in.""

But in the end, due partly to Dumbeldore, and wholly to Harry's strength as a boy and a man and a wizard--they win. Dumbeldore's plan worked. The ends may have justified the means--who knows how many boys and girls Harry's age and younger would have died underneath Voldemort's reign, had Albus not molded Harry from the beginning. Albus is complicated, but when he sees Harry again and says these words, you know he means them:

>""Harry."" He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. ""You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.""  This 100%! Dumbledore was a good man who tried his best to fight for good, but had times when he fell short or was otherwise caught in the kind of situation where what was ‘good’ wasn’t black and white. 

I mean, is it ethical to protect one person from their natural fate of death if it means that preventing them from dying will cause thousands of other people to die and suffer? 

That was the situation Dumbledore was given because Harry was *always* going to have to face off against Voldemort no matter what Dumbledore did. There is no, ‘pig for the slaughter’, it was inevitable because Voldemort chose to follow the prophecy and make it self-fulfilling.
It was always just a matter of when.

He could *try* to stop Harry from doing so, but if he did then Voldemort also would also never be defeated, and while he was alive he would continue his campaign of genocide against not only those who opposed him, but also innocent people like the muggles he wanted to rule over and the muggleborns who he and his followers wanted to commit genocide against.

How could he in good conscience then, choose to protect just Harry versus protecting the whole rest of the world just because he knew Harry and cared about him as a child? So Dumbledore’s solution was to try to give Harry as many tools and protections as he could because he couldn’t stop the inevitable, while also not sacrificing the rest of the world either. 

And the fact that he tried his damnedest to protect both is what makes him a good person in my eyes because I understand that it was a bad situation itself.

Part of my assessment of Dumbledore is also the fact that while the fandom for some reason thinks he’s like a god or something who controls and manipulates everything, Dumbledore himself was just a man who was both forced by necessity but also proudly took on the responsibility of protecting the Wizarding world. He wasn’t infallible; he had limits to his judgments and understanding of situations just like everyone else. He just had a lot more intelligence to go around so it always seemed that he had more control over the situation than he actually did. And part of this is that he was written to flip-flop between being super knowing while also not being perfect. 

But the concept that Dumbledore is the chess master (versus someone forced by fate) is because of an overestimation of how much control over the situation he had; the honest answer is not much, but people were looking to him to keep things under control.  The thing is, even if Dumbledore was raising Harry to sacrifice himself, it would be worth it.  I mean, what's one life against the rest of the world?  It would suck for Harry being the one sacrificed but it's objectively a good trade.  Dumbledore also sacrificed himself, technically twice so it's not like he's asking things of others that he's not willing to do himself.  He (I assume) knew that destroying the horcrux would kill him, then had Snape speed things along to protect Malfoy.  

I like this interpretation because it makes him a bit less of a paragon of heroism and more like what he was - a general leading an army against Voldemort that occasionally has to sacrifice the lives of those under his command.

Now he did give Harry a way out but there was always a solid chance Harry didn't figure it out and you have to think that Dumbledore had considered that and still thought it was worth the risk  So.... he did not tell Snape because he knew or suspected that Harry was eventually gonna see Snape's memories? Is this like 6D chess or something? Snape had a very good point that Dumbledore was using Harry as a pawn (it's basically the only time Snape actually stands up for Harry). Why did Dumbledore NOT EVEN THEN tell the real truth??  I agree for the most part, but I have a couple quibbles.

First, if I remember the scene correctly, Dumbledore’s triumph was immediately followed by a much less triumphant look.  It could be that he realized he needed to put on an act for Snape. But to me it seemed the look of triumph was Dumbledore realizing his theories and been right, and the next reaction was him realizing his theories being right meant that Harry would have to die. I think you are totally right though that Dumbledore at some point figured out a different plan where Harry didn’t die but needed to think he would.

Second, your comment about using Snape confuses me. Dumbledore could have given partial information to anyone. He chose Snape because he needed someone to carry the information after his own death, and Snape was his most reliable and trusted agent. Dumbledore, as a repentant former evildoer himself, understands and trusts Snape. He also knows Snape is coldly capable of doing what must be done no matter how distasteful. Dumbledore knew Snape better than Snape did.  That one quote isn't the only reason I have issues with Dumbledore's approach.  He proved himself to be incredibly manipulative throughout the series.  While his intentions were good, his implementation of those intentions were not.

1. Aberforth said Dumbledore ""learned secrecy at our mother's knee.  Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up, and Albus was a natural ... people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans ... many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he'd left 'em well alone"" (Deathly Hallows 561, 562).  Even with whatever bias Aberforth had, this is an accurate assessment.
2. Dumbledore admits this to Harry in King's Cross when he says, ""I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine"" (Deathly Hallow 715 - 716).  This is a Dumbledore who no longer has anything to hide and is finally being honest with Harry about who he is.
3. When Harry returns to Hogwarts for the last time, he has to choose between being secretive like Dumbledore or trusting the rest of Dumbledore's Army (a fascinating parallel to Harry's choice between Gryffindor and Slytherin when he first got to Hogwarts!)  Just like with the Sorting Hat, Harry chooses Gryffindor qualities over the Slytherin qualities we had learned Dumbledore had possessed.
4. His lack of action in Harry's childhood, despite knowing what the Dursley's were doing to him, made him complicit in the abuse he suffered.  He even tells Harry that he knew he ""was condemning you \[Harry\] to ten dark and difficult years"" (Order of the Phoenix 835) when he left Harry with the Dursleys.  There are plenty of ways Dumbledore could have arranged for Harry to be treated well while allowing the Dursleys to have the appearance of normality that they wanted.  Dumbledore even said he only had to ""return there only once a year, but as long as you still call it home, there he cannot hurt you"" (Phoenix 836).  This means Dumbledore knew he did not have to spend his entire childhood with the Dursleys, yet he condemned him to a decade of constant abuse.
5. Mrs. Figg said she did nothing about the abuse under ""Dumbledore's orders.  I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young.  I'm sorry I gave you such a miserable time, but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they'd thought you enjoyed it."" (Phoenix 22).  Not only did Dumbledore do nothing to make it better, he sent one of his agents into Harry life and actively made it worse.  The abuse he suffered became worse because of Dumbledore's machievellian plans.
6. Professor McGonagall even warned Dumbledore about the Dursleys.  Yet he made no adjustments to his plans, even though he was warned about how terrible they were.
7. Dumbledore's secrecy is seen throughout the series.  one of the clearest examples is why Dumbledore never makes eye contact with Harry in Order of the Phoenix.  He could have written a letter to Harry or had Professor McGonagall speak to Harry on his behalf.  She'd be a perfect person to do this since she was head of Gryffindor and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.  This would have saved Harry from needless stress, provided him with necessary answers, and given Harry to become much more agency in his own life.  It also would have gone a long way in helping Harry understand Voldemort's goals with the Department of Mysteries, allowing Harry and friends to avoid the dangers of being attacked by Death Eaters.  While Harry was protected by love, Sirius clearly wasn't.  Dumbledore's secrecy was a major factor in putting the Order in danger, leading to Sirius' death.  Just like the Dursleys exerted control over Harry by keeping him ignorant of his magical heritage, Dumbledore exerts control over Harry by keeping him ignorant of what is happening.
8. There's also his involvement with Grindelwald, which I don't have the time to talk about at the moment!

While Dumbledore's plan worked, it worked ONLY because Harry broke free of his secrecy and decided to trust people when he returned to Hogwarts.  He trusted the DA and McGonagall.  If he hadn't, he never would have known to go after the Ravenclaw diadem.

I find Dumbledore to be one of the most fascinating characters in the series, but he has some pretty huge flaws.  While this adds to his complexity and makes him more fascinating, it also prevents him from being the idealized wizard so many make him out to be."

"Harry and the waitress in Half Blood Prince had more chemistry than Harry and Ginny in the movies - EDIT:

This is my first post and I just came back to check on reddit , thank you for the awards and upvotes, I'm emotional now y'all ",2020-09-27 05:37:48,18604,135,0.7269,"Harry had more chemistry with Mrs. Weasley than with Ginny.  Totally. Remember that scene in the beginning of HBP when they're in Fred and George's shop and the twins are teasing Ginny about dating Dean? And Harry is listening in and looking all jealous about it. The movies needed more tension and stuff like that to set the stage for their relationship, IMO. Stuff kind of from his narrative point of view that didn't make their relationship seem so out of the blue and forced and awkward.

That and movie Ginny having a deeper personality would have helped -_-  To be fair, my hottest HP take is that Daniel Radcliffe and the actress who played the waitress had a ton of chemistry. That's the spiciest romance scene in the films.  Slightly off topic, but can I just say - writers of HbP movie, what the heck were you thinking with that scene? Voldy is out there, the Ministry does shit to catch him, but Harry is all alone in a random cafe with NOONE to protect him? It was explicitly stated in the book that he could not leave the house at Privet Dr because of the concerns for his safety. 

He goes to the Burrow next that is given all the magical protection in the world. But I guess the movie version of the Order didn't think the Death Eaters would be interested in killing Harry during the summer? Decided to give him vacations? I wonder what Bellatrix was thinking when they burned the Burrow, ""oh if only Potter didn't have vacations now or else we would be able to CAPTURE HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING FIELD WHERE NOONE IS THERE TO HELP HIM""  I might not be a Hinny fan, but the movies really messed up with the two of them getting together. The way they set it up... I have seen more complexity in a lamp from IKEA  Harry at 8PM one summer evening: I think I like that girl, I should ask her out. 

Harry at 12PM that very day: Oh look Ginny! This girl I started to have feelings for, for no particular reason.  They really did them an injustice there. The book really leads up to them getting together, not just have one cringey kiss in secret...  I agree. For some reason I was rooting for them from the first seconds even though I knew that wasn't the case  Could have sworn someone said this last week and the week before and the week before  Forever disappointed that Harry did not end up with Luna"
He has his mother's eyes - T'is my first meme,2024-12-18 19:02:02,15322,164,0.0,"They literally had one job for casting his mom.  Man posted two pics of Harry's eyes like we wouldn't notice 🙄  Common misconception. 
They don't mean that his eyes are just like his mother's. 
They're saying that he has his mother's eyes. 
Literally. 
In a little baggy. Memento type of deal.  I find it very odd and almost a bit disrespectful to Snape’s death that they could not cast a girl who had Daniel Radcliffe’s eyes when it is literally Snape’s dying line shortly before the pensive scene. This is Snape’s memory. The girl who plays Lily barely has any lines. Was it that hard to find a ginger girl with blue eyes who wanted to be in the last Harry Potter movie? This should have been one of the top priorities while casting  This is the thing that annoys me the most in the movies. I don’t even care he has blue eyes instead of green, Daniel was a kid in the beginning and couldn’t wear the color lenses, it’s fine. But why on hell couldn’t they cast a ginger girl with blue eyes???? It makes no sense  I don’t like to nitpick like some people but this was so annoying. It doesn’t matter if Dan Radcliffe’s eyes are green, but it does matter if Harry and Lily are the same. It’s repeated so many times. So cast a little girl with the same eye color as Dan, come on. It’s not difficult. She doesn’t even need to be a redhead, hair dye exists.  Like, in a box somewhere.  And they're both wrong, they are supposed to have bright GREEN eyes!  And the thing is, Lilly is seen on screen so infrequently that it wouldn't have been tha hard to put her actress in colored contacts.  This annoyed the hell out of me, but I recently read that this girl did in fact wear blue contact lenses. In post production they weren’t visible though, as her natural eye colour is just too dark/„strong“ for the rather light blue colour that Daniel‘s eyes (and thus her contacts) have. As for digital altering - I can’t really remember whether it looked too fake or just didn’t work for any other reason, but it still kind of put my mind to ease because even though it failed, they did at least try. So yey.

"I love how basically every ""Why didn't Voldemort..."" question can just be explained by the fact that he's a total drama queen. - Why didn't Voldemort just let one of his many, many followers kill Harry when they had the chance? Because this is HIS show and he will NOT be upstaged.

Why didn't Voldemort make a Horcrux out of a grain of sand and chunk it into the ocean? Because he's the coolest wizard in the land who gave Death the middle finger, and so every Horcrux has to be something special or important.

Why didn't Voldemort just take a glock and shoot Harry in the face? Because aesthetics is everything and of COURSE he needs to kill Harry in the most dramatic way possible.

Why did Voldemort hatch and execute an extremely elaborate plan during Harry's fourth year involving several people that could have gone wrong at multiple points just to kidnap Harry, get his blood, and kill him? Because he's Lord Fucking Voldemort thankyouverymuch.

Why did Voldemort deduce that Harry was the Chosen One and not Neville? Because Harry was a half-blood wizard just like Voldemort so OF COURSE the Super Special Prophecied Chosen One Magical Boy Wizard would be exactly like Voldemort.

Why did Voldemort never learn to become an Animagus? Because he's the greatest wizard of all time and why would he ever choose to become a filthy animal howdareyou.

What did Voldemort do after he was denied a teaching job at Hogwarts? He literally placed a curse on that position because if he doesn't get the job, then no one does.

Why did Voldemort place a taboo on his own name? Because of course that's a practical way to find his enemies, but also because he has a great sense of Brand Integrity and he LOVES how iconic the whole ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"" stuff is.

Not to mention that he was so obsessed with theatrics and drama that he, as a teenage boy, not only probably spent hours every night writing in his diary and rearranging the letters of his name until he came up with ""I am Lord Voldemort"" and decided that would be an awesome name, but also started a club for emo racist goths and made all his friends actively call him that for the rest of his life.",2020-10-08 00:46:36,11966,140,0.9437,"Why did he choose the graveyard his father was buried in for his resurrection?

Maybe it was just a one-time thing? But reading the book, I see clearly the type of person he is! Arrogant! Mean! He is a bully! He took Snape as his victim and behaved horribly towards him. Why does everyone want to make him seem like the perfect nice wizard? We didn't get the opportunity to know him as an adult, but I am shocked by his behavior! Snape was right from A to Z about him. He was a true victim. That scene in the park where he was just minding his own business and reading, and Black and Potter came to him to humiliate him in front of others just because they were bored… crazy to me! Not saying that Snape is a good person!! But James Potter WAS A BULLY! He is worse than Malfoy at that time. I. Don’t. Like. Him. ! ",2024-04-25 18:29:00,12446,134,-0.9881,"Nobody does. Not 15-year old James Potter anyways.

He was also exceptionally poorly cast in the movies imo. He was supposed to be a rather small-statured, good looking jock with untameable hair. And they cast a tall, lanky dude with the looks of your average school chess club president with the mellowest hair I’ve ever seen.  You are on the emotional roller coaster that the story wants to take you on! A major theme in this series is that NO ONE is totally good or totally bad (except Umbridge). OOTP shows us Harry having that kind of normal kid moment of realizing your parents are flawed humans and not just total heroes, though he is doing it in a unique way. Sirius and Lupin even immediately agree that they all were kind of jerks as teenagers and had a lot of growing up to do. 

Snape is a complex character but he is absolutely not 100% the victim. The movies soften a lot of Snape's character and Alan Rickman is so lovable, but if you really want to understand these dynamics you really need to read the books.  does anyone like any 15 year old boys????  To me he’s just another stupid annoying teenager. I think Harry gets overly upset about things he finds out James did but it’s understandable as he’s put his parents James especially on a pedestal and Dumbledore actually. 

I guess because Harry’s adolescence isn’t carefree in anyway really and any mistake has big consequences, he can’t help feeling frustrated at others for being stupid teenagers/kids and making mistakes.  I didn’t much like 15 year old me  I mean that was the point? Like Harry talks to Sirius and Remus about this and they admit that he (and they) were dicks. They also mentioned that he stopped being a dick after this and that's why Lily eventually gave him a chance. 

I would argue that Sirius was a bigger dick since he literally almost got Snape killed AND exposed Remus as being a werewolf to him.  I would highly recommend reading the books. The characters are far more nuanced than in the movies.  Lily didn’t like him either. She called him “an arrogant toe rag.” 
But he did have a crush on Lily. However, it seems while one headed in a very dark direction & then as Lily says “evil” as she cuts him off from friendship; it seems the other started to mature as he aged; & started to see the error of his ways. Lily is a very empathetic human & doesn’t seem the type to be taken in by some arrogant bully. Something must’ve changed in James, to cause Lily to fall in love with him. Also James & Lily became “famous” in the wizarding world due to their steadfast fight against dark wizards & Voldemort “thrice defying him.”
But even Sirius recognized what they did & said to Peter “I should’ve known about you back then. You weren’t our friends, you just delighted in surrounding yourself around stronger people to watch them bully others” or however it was worded in POA.
Even Harry is really disturbed at watching his father bully Snape. Even after he found out he cringed knowing it was coming when he was looking at Snape’s memories thru the pensive.
I’m sure it’s tough to see your father that way; someone you not only idolize, but you are constantly compared to.

Again, Lily was witness to at least 1 of these acts as she stepped in to defend Snape & that’s when Snape called her a “filthy mud blood.” 

People change & mature. Tho Snape questions the sincerity in the act; Dumbledore does not as he tells Harry that James saved Snape’s life. 
Many people that knew them both well seemed to know James both as a teen & a man; & they tend to like the adult James. This is a pretty strong indication, along with Lily ability to fall for him, that he truly changed. Lupin was one of those people. He did not participate in the bullying but he was witness to it.
He had great things to say about James as a man.
But even as a kid, James doesn’t seem like Malfoy. When Sirius was having trouble as a kid; James seemed to make him part of the family; as Ron did with Harry.
People are complex; especially FICTIONAL characters. All I can say is I wish JK Rowling revealed more details into the story of how Lily ended up going from thinking James an arrogant toe rag bully; to someone to marry & father a child with. Something changed & everyone deserves a 2nd chance. That’s one of the lessons of this book. The Malfoys were given a 2nd chance. & Even Voldemort was offered a chance at remorse by Harry; his total enemy; before his death. Even Albus Dumbledore, the wise mentor; who took down 2 of the darkest wizards of the ages; & saved Harry in the process, & saved Draco’s soul; Albus was planning world domination with his lover & trying to hide his ill sister under an invisibility cloak & take her around the world doing so.. which led to a fight where she died. 
He seemed to spend the rest of his life avoiding power & trying to make amends for such things.
This story is about human mistakes & being remorseful to try to make amends; aka paths of redemption; as much as it is about the power of Love & the secret hero magical journey against evil.  Nobody ever said hes perfect so idk what youre talking about. Its generally accepted he was a douche in school and mellowed out as he matured. Snape wasnt an angel either  Even Harry didn't like 15 year old james"

I’m sending lots of love to American Potterheads, who’ve given me some of the most memorable moments of my Potter-related life! @Scholastic #HarryPotter20 🇺🇸 ⚡️❤️

I can't believe it's been 20 years. We're getting old, aren't we? :P",2018-09-05 12:12:43,13921,83,0.8272,"20 years since I tried to convince my mom that even though they're using magic, the book isn't ""demonic"". 

15 years since I won that battle (due to the books being worth so many points on those stupid accelerated reader quizzes)  My aunt's friend from America was visiting Australia and staying with my aunt. She gave me the first Harry Potter book for my birthday. It must have been for my 9th birthday in March 1999.

So I have a lot to thank Americans for too! <3  It’s the 20th anniversary of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone being mistitled

(Just kidding don’t hurt me)  Oh thank god, a post that's guaranteed to be at the top of the front page of this subreddit. Now we can put the temporarily revived shipping war currently occupying the front page back to rest.  The summer before the 5th grade I was staying at a family friends house and every night we would all pile into friend’s moms bed and she would read to us. She read Harry Potter to us. I was about to start at a new school after being bullied at my old school. 

I was really scared about switching schools. 

Harry Potter not only gave me the bravery to make new friends, but I learned so much about standing up for what is right from those books. 


I am a serious Potterhead now, and I really think that those books helped shape me into the empathetic, strong and hard working person that I am today. 


-FRIENDS MOM- is on the other side of the curtain now and at her funeral it all hit me. She probably have me the most meaningful gift that I could ever receive-the love of reading, the gift of imagination, and magic. 


I wish that I could have thanked her properly, but who knows, maybe when she crossed over she gained the knowledge of all the impacts that she made while she was here.   20 years since I got my first copy which sat on a bookshelf untouched until one stormy night in 2007 when I decided to pick it up out of boredom.   Two weeks later I'm finishing HBP and going to barnes and noble for the DH release. I have been obsessed ever since.   Ugh. I remember reading the first book for the first time like it was yesterday. This post reminds me that it wasn't yesterday   I was 43 and hadn't read a book in a long while. I remember seeing all the stories about the whole Potter phenomenon and bought the book on a whim. I read it straight through. I've been a fan ever since.   I'm just glad that Rowling didn't mail it in for the last few books after gaining extraordinary wealth and success. 

I'm looking at you, hunger games, divergent, and song of ice and fire.   Yup the original HP generation is getting up there 🤣😫"

Wtf is Marshal Zhukov doing in Harry Potter ?  For someone who has watched most of his interviews and panels: He's said this for the last 20 years  he was only given the Malfoy role in the second movie because the producers felt bad for passing him over for Hermione in the first movie. its the role he was born to play  The most unserious dude in the entire film series. 😂😂"

So Warner asks him to resign while Amber Heard is filming reshots of the Snyder Cut? What an utterly despicable move  I hate this.

"Just because you like Harry Potter does not mean you have to defend J.K. Rowling - It is okay to appreciate the series for what it is, and it's message, even if the author doesn't fully live up to the values they wrote about.

Celebrity worship is wrong and just because someone created something you enjoyed, does not mean you have to follow them off the edge of every cliff they choose to publicly step over.

That's all.",2020-06-07 16:35:05,27465,51,0.9042,"Loved the 7 books, watched all 8 movies. Don't care for her extracurriculars.  What is she saying?  Same feelings with Enders Game and Orson Scott Card  In a similar vein, the guy who created Minecraft, Notch, is a horrible human being, but people still enjoy Minecraft. It's a weird line, but a distinction can be made.  Regardless of your opinion on her opinion, I would like to point out she chose to have this fight using her platform at the beginning of Pride Month, during global anti-racism protests and against police brutality.

I love HP and the message in it. I have always tried to push JK's views on trans people out of my head because it made me feel uncomfortable to have someone I respected and a series I loved tarnished that way. 

But I can't have my eyes opened to everything going on in the world recently, and then when another form of bigotry comes along, pretend it doesn't exist because it makes me feel bad to acknowledge.

These books will always have a place in my heart, but Rowling doesn't need to be in my heart, and she no longer is.  As a corollary to that- just because her trans comments are weird does not mean you have to bury J.K Rowling on every other societal issue by calling her ""*racist, anti-semitic and so on*"" to make her the ""big bad"".

It is entirely possible for one person to have bad/non-kosher opinions on one topic but yet be on the ""good"" side of things on pretty much every other issue. We do not need to tear everything about JK and HP series down in order to express dissatisfaction with her recent tweets.  I have had zero interest in anything Rowling has done since Deathly Hallows were published.   I bought the books, they belong to me, and nothing Rowling or anyone else has said since has changed my enjoyment of those books.  People started hero worshipping JK, then when it became obvious she's a flawed human just like everyone those same people turned on her. She's a person who has thoughts and feelings not everyone will agree with. People wanted her to be this great Champion of Human Rights, and she's a human who in her own way follows her own truth and does what she thinks is best.  I didn't follow what happened recently.  
But I have to say too, that even though you're right, the opposite is also true.

If someone defends JKR, it doesn't mean that they're blindly following her just because they're a fan of Harry Potter...  well yeah. separate the artist from the art. ALWAYS.

"My Take On Snape: You didn't like Snape, you liked Alan Rickman. Alan Rickman made Snape feel redeemable. Book Snape was terrible from start to finish. - Not calling this a hot take because it's not a hot take, it's just facts.
-----

Update:
He was a wonderfully written character but book!Snape was still a dumpster fire of a human being.

Alan Rickman's portrayal of him in the movies, however, was nuanced, brilliant, and absolutely sold me on the idea that maybe the was more to movie!Snape them I'd thought.

Meta Musing:
I didn't realize that this kind of post was considered to be ""a repost,"" but if you're truly that grumpy with either the ""repost"" that it represents or feel ""no you're wrong!"" then might I suggest simply downvoting the post and moving on without commenting?

Because the more you engage with it and the more comments you leave, the more redditors will make posts like this and more the reddit algorithm will promote them.

Clarification:
Being abused does not justify abusing others. Continuing the cycle condemns you, it doesn't free you. Sirius was probably as immature about Harry as Snape was, yes, but he'd also spent ""TWELVE YEARS!! IN AZKABAN!!"" so he's probably a bit twitchier them he'd be if he'd had twelve years to mature outside of Nightmare Wizard Prison.

Again, Snape is a Great Character, certainly one with more nuance than Lord ""Can't Even Kill A Baby."" He's just a dumpster fire of a person.",2022-01-06 21:29:48,16237,221,0.9494,"But book Snape is so funny.  We like bastards and grey characters? Yes. 
We like Alan Rickman's performance? Yes. 
Is this any of your concerns? No  As a longtime fan of dumpster fire characters, I can confidently assure you that I liked Snape before the movies came out.  Such a fuckin redditor title, lmao who do you think you are trying to tell people what they liked and didn't? Absolute arrogance of someone with no life experience  Hot take: I liked Snape before the movies. 

Another hot take: You're allowed to like the villains in a story.

Yet another hot take: Complex characters with gray morality are more fun to read about than all-good and all-bad characters.  Oh boy another Snape thread, it's been a whole 2 hours  >You didn't like Snape, you liked Alan Rickman.  
>  
>Not calling this a hot take because it's not a hot take, **it's just facts.**

How do you know whats fact or not? There's alot of people that read the books well before they watched the movies, including me. Snape had my interest from the start. I think when you start understanding that people can love morally grey characters is the day we stop seeing these ""snape bad, why do people like him"" type posts on this sub.  People like what they like. It's not for you to decide, so stop telling them what they should/do feel.  I have more empathy for book Snape than movie Snape.  I think that the problem with Snape is that though he's clearly a grey character, the way he is described can be summarized as a huge canvas all painted in black, with a few white lines on the surface. His cruelty and bias as a teacher are nearly grotesque. And they are also very memorable because he is clever and witty. 

They also don't have a solid counterbalance up until the very end, because there are no humanizing touches. Looking through Harry's eyes, we are trapped in the ""Snape's rude - Snape's the big bad guy - Oh, alright, he wasn't the bad guy after all,"" until he turns out to be bad (though it's not convincing) only to reveal his true colors just before his death. He has no friends, no relationships in which he shows a different side.

If I were Rowling, I'd give him a few scenes in which he shows that his emotional range as an adult is a bit wider than what he demonstrates in front of Harry. Let him have a meaningful student-teacher relationship with Draco, give him a friend, whatever. But I'm not, so nevermind.

Still, I disagree that Snape has no redeeming qualities. He has a strong sense of duty, he's loyal to Dumbledore -- I know he has his reasons, but everyone has.

I also strongly believe that in the end, he did more good than bad. As readers, we are pushed to think more about what is described in more detail (like his bullying). We don't witness him having to endure pretending to be Voldemort's servant, even though Voldemort killed the one person he cared about. I don't think that with everything that happened to them, Hermione, Harry, or Neville were severely impacted by Snape's bullying. But their whole world was definitely impacted by his double-agent work.

Of course, all that I said is just for the fun of it, because it would be possible to like Snape even if he was all dark. Heroes, villains, or those in-between, they tend to be more likeable if they are interesting and witty (like Snape), compared to just annoying and boring (like Fudge or Lucius Malfoy, at least the way I see them). Think Game of Thrones -- I haven't met one person who likes Geoffrey but plenty of people who like Cersei."
One of the saddest quotes imo - Also it's very human and occasionally relatable unfortunately. Any of those times you were completely exhausted and just felt 'done'.,2025-02-12 12:57:30,12638,52,-0.8366,"It's wild to me that fan fiction focuses so much on Dumbledore manipulating Harry when the books clearly show him at the peak of his game while manipulating Snape.  It's even deeper than that. At this point, not doing it would cost him his life. It actually means ""maybe I should die for you"" in a very passive agressive Snape way.  Too real.  It’s one of the saddest quotes, but the saddest is “only those whom I could not save”.  He had to be tired mentally and emotionally. Playing both sides and playing them well. I just wanna hug him in this scene. 🥺🥺🥺  If the devil wants to dance, you had better say never..  Please let's not turn this into another ""Snape was actually a jackass thread"".

I'm just going to appreciate the quote and leave the rest aside.  Man he was on another level of sarcasm+,passive aggressiveness  That’s been me the past like five years.  A lot of people are indeed feeling that way."
"People in the Harry Potter Fandom Who Complain About the Movies Don’t Know How Good They Have it. - I’m part of the Percy Jackson fandom.

also, His Dark Materials.  I’m sure Artemis Fowl and Eragon fans would second this  AtLA fans represent! Where the entire fandom pretends there is no movie.  Artemis Fowl fan checking in to commiserate. If Fowl had Potter’s following, the studio would have been vandalized.  I'm a teacher. One of the books in the 6th grade curriculum in NY is the first Percy Jackson book. After reading the book we showed the kids the movie. They all complained about how bad it is compared to the book.  Imagine killing the series main villain in the second movie, when he was defeated in the fifth book...

That's the PJ movies.  Other than Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter fans have it better than any other fans of a book franchise when it comes to film adaptations. All 8 of the movies are very well made, despite certain entries being better ADAPTATIONS than others. In terms of technical filmmaking and the amount of care that went into those movies, we are VERY lucky to have them.  The Artemis Fowl “film” has inflicted a fresh wound.  The HP movies are 8 great movies. Only, not all of them are great adaptations.  POA has some if the best shots and transitions of any movie I have seen."

"Reading the Chamber of secrets, and I had a thought about Ron's Christmas gift to Harry. - Ron gives Harry the Cannons book, so he could read all about rons favorite quidditch team. I was reading and I realized, and growing up poor myself, I had given away things that I liked to people for Christmas or their birthday,  because I didn't have the money to buy them something else. I would give away a book or a game I really liked and told them I thought they would like it, which was true, I tried to give them something they would enjoy, but it was more because I couldn't go to the store to buy toys or something for really anyone. Ron's gift made me think of this, and I wonder if Ron did the same thing.

Edit. Just got back from work and saw this blow up. Thanks so much for all the love this got,  you all gave such kind words and thoughts. Super glad to be apart of this Fandom rn c: you guys made my day!",2020-06-18 21:09:19,11608,86,0.9906,"This is a fantastic connection to the story. I think you’re right.  You know, I never really thought about the gift all that much, but I think you're right. It's not like Ron would have had the money to purchase another copy, anyway. It's bittersweet, because I grew up very poor and gave away most of my treasured possessions this way.

This hit me right in the feels.  This is actually really wholesome :) I hope you have a great day OP, you’ve certainly made my day  ooh this makes perfect sense!  I'm going through my yearly reread and in the Deathly Hallows Ron gives Harry his copy of ""12 sure fire ways to charm witches"" or something like that, which he says was a gift from Fred and George, so yes I think you're right.

I also believe it was because Harry had no real experience with quidditch teams, and Ron wanted his best friend to become a fan of his own favorite team.  I can get behind this theory. I did the same thing.  This had never occurred to me. I grew up lower middle class and while we didn’t have a lot of money we did have money for gifts and all the basics and a few splurges every year. 

I don’t think I ever gave away something of mine as a gift in this way. I would just buy another one. I feel pretty fortunate right now. I have worked with a lot of kids in poverty so I’m not completely disconnected but this isn’t something I realized was typical. 

Thanks OP. It gives a new light to the gift and makes it more special.  That's probably what happened. I can remember doing similar things when I was a child. Either presents would be home made (usually hand-sewn) or they would be things I bought second hand.  You find new stuff reading the books every time, and I think it's an amazing instance of Ron's generosity and true friendship to Harry.  I don't remember which book it is, but I remember Harry had read it multiple times - I believe 10?"

My favorite response is that it’s in-universe fiction, written by Rita Skeeter, desperate to cling to relevance and presented as fact.  My mom sweetly bought it for me not knowing, so I tried to read it but it was so bad I couldn’t even get more than like a third through. The plot holes and typos just showed how much they cared—they just churned it out for $$$

Edit: a few of you asked about the typos, I don’t have my book with me (and even if I did I wouldn’t want to look for them haha) but I found this review so I know I’m not imagining it! “...The Cursed Child is crap. The dialogue is stilted, there are typos all over the place, characterisation is very limited, people drop out and reappear in a very unsatisfying way (characters gain and lose siblings due to textual inconsistencies AS WELL AS the effects of reckless time travel), and the whole thing seems rushed and not in keeping with the rules of the magical world we’ve previously met.”

Like, how is that an acceptable method of keeping kids on a train!? 

""Damn they've got out. Here I go killin' again""  Hahaha. I was so ready to read the discourse. 

Despite its flaws though, I did enjoy some of the characterization. I'll happily accept Draco Malfoy being a good parent as canon. I'm weak for themes of children growing up and learning from their parent's mistakes.  Cursed Child reads basically like an indie screenwriter's dream edgy story about father and son troubles that he had to force into a Harry Potter mold."

So no ones talking about how the actual answer is Snape came up with the edit to the plan and fed it to mundungus. He needed it to be a plan he could throw a monkey wrench into. He needed to be right so voldy would trust him.

Sir they're going to move the boy as a muggle. 

Good well intercept the car going 30 kph through a british suburb with expansion charms on the trunk. 

What is Snape going to do to fix that, suggest 7 cars?

Edit: Ok I'm tired. Dumbledore portrait gave Snape the plan to give to voldemort and change for mundungus.

Edit 2. The portrait suggests the 7 potters. Order was already moving him under guard. So Snape discovered the plan and modified it, he didnt develope the plan in its entirety  Isn't it because Harry is meant to be kept alive at all costs, so vomdemort can kill him? so having multiple of them is confusing and let's the real Harry get a better change at escaping, it also semi protects the others from kill on sight  Because that’s kinda dumb. They know where Harry lives. So if a ton of wizards go into the Dursley’s, and then come out with a random muggle from the place Harry lives…..that’s gonna be a bit suspicious. They would just kill all but the muggle, then see if he’s important. If not, kill him too. Voldemort and his followers weren’t stupid. Well. Most of them weren’t stupid.  Probably the thinking of the eaters was “Kill on site kill everyone. Cant kill harry though he is to be given to the boss for personal reasons”.  Doesn’t Harry still have the trace on him? Multiple Harry’s in one location obscures the Death Eaters accuracy when relying upon The Trace.


They also need to follow Dumbledore’s Grand Scheme.  He had an invisibility cloak, could have easily snuck away from the dursleys. They could have taken him anywhere.   Like the have a “delivery” brought to the house then Harry sneaks away in the delivery truck.  Wizards only plan like wizards.  It was actually a smart move. If Harry had fled under disguise, Voldemort and co would have searched for him around. In that case, everyone who is not wearing Deatheaters mask is a target, wizards or not. This would have ended with a big massacre of muggles in the neighborhood. Even considering Harry as key to defeating Voldemort, we don't do that here.

On the other hand, several Harry's running away made Deatheaters instantly focus on chasing them, splitting up in the process. Which made them less dangerous than they were in the group. For members of the Order, it was part of a plan, so they made into groups with people that they work well. On the contrary, Deatheaters split unevenly and randomly, which in some cases could make them easier to take down.  Honestly, I think the beauty of magic is that you are so hell-bent on using it that you ignore the more obvious and simple solutions. Voldemort using a killing spell on a harmless baby rather than a pillow will always confuse me....  Harry still has the trace on him. Even if he is disguised as a muggle, they can still trace him because Voldemorts followers are present in the ministry. Also, Voldemort knee they were going to ship Harry that night, so finding a dozen of Harry takes them aback and gives a better plan than a random muggle who is being protected by a bunch of witches and wizards."
"The Seven Potters was the most ridiculous and illogical plan - Why not have Harry use the Invisibility Cloak and move him using Muggle transportation? Why not have him use Polyjuice Potion? Why not have him leave with the Dursleys and then Apparate alongside Dedalus or Hestia once they were far enough away? Why not just ignore the Ministry and set up an illegal Portkey (Dumbledore did it several times and nothing happened—do they even have a way to track this)? Why not have Moody transfigure Harry into a ferret and carry him in his pocket? 

In conclusion, they really could’ve used a Ravenclaw in this group to assist in making wiser decisions.

Right! And having seven of them flying nearby makes them easier to spot than just one. You know if you get one or two you either have him or someone close to him.  Its only ridiculous and illogical if you assume that the only reason they're using this plan is to move Harry. However, this plan accomplished more than just moving Harry from point A to point B. 

First of all, it made Snape look like a valuable spy to Voldemort. By passing on some details of the plan but not others he was able to prove his value to Voldemort even though his cover had been burned in the previous book. This may not seem like much, but doing so sets Snape up to become Headmaster at Hogwarts come September, and allows him to protect the school from the likes of the Carrows. 

Secondly, it confuses the Death Eaters to the actual location that Harry gets moved too. With Seven Potters flying to Seven Safehouses they no longer know where to attack. So, when they finally take over the ministry and can break the enchantments around the safehouses, they have to split their forces up and search all seven, as opposed to simply surrounding one place and collapsing on it with their full force. 

Thirdly, they once again manage a blow against Voldemort's reputation and undermine his power and sow doubt among his followers. By having Harry escape in full view of death eaters, Voldemort can't hide the fact that he has failed to kill Harry again, and was still being outsmarted by Dumbledore even though he's dead. 

None of the ideas you suggested would have kept Harry any safer than the plan of the seven potters. Most of them would rely on the Death Eaters not knowing about the order needing to move Harry, but we already know that they are aware and they haven't taken the bait of the false trail. Polyjuice potion wouldn't work if they were watching for Harry to Leave, they would know the second the enchantment failed he was trying to escape. The Dursley's leave before Harry because the enchantment protecting them doesn't break until Harry Leaves, so Harry leaving after them buys them extra time to get away safely. If anyone moved Harry using Illegal Methods they would be arrested by the people working for Voldemort in the ministry and be held as hostages against Harry. Transfiguration wouldn't work because they were watching for Harry to leave, any member of the order would have been intercepted once they carried Harry far enough from the house to break the enchantment. 

&#x200B;

Finally, you have to keep in mind that while you the reader have information, either from the narration or in retrospect, at the time the characters making these decisions wouldn't have had that information and it doesn't make sense to assume that they would act on this information. For Example Harry's Cloak: Normal Invisibility cloaks can be detected by using spells, if the person searching knows that a wizard is using one nearby, and Harry's Cloak is common knowledge. No one Alive at the start of the Seventh book, when the Night of the Seven Potters takes places, knows that Harry's cloak is a hallow, and will give him added defense against said detection spells, not even Harry and Hermione. So the Order wouldn't rely on Harry's Cloak to protect him once the enchantment broke.  Well if they had transfigured Harry into a ferret and hidden in Moody’s pocket, he’d probably have gotten smooshed when they killed Moody.  They all just wanted to come to Harry's house  >Why not have Harry use the Invisibility Cloak and move him using Muggle transportation?

They didn't know it was a Hallow,  as far as the Order knew it was just a regular invisibility cloak which was not infallible. They'd already lost one of Moody's cloaks at the Ministry in Order of the Phoenix (Sturgis Podmore was using it when he was arrested while guarding the Department of Mysteries). Leaving Harry to fend for himself with nothing but an invisibility cloak would be suicide.

>Why not have him use Polyjuice Potion?

They know the Death Eaters aren't aiming to kill Harry, but they *will* aim to kill anyone else. Having more people disguised as Harry is actually safer. If anything they should have gone for 14 Potters!

>Why not have him leave with the Dursleys and then Apparate alongside Dedalus or Hestia once they were far enough away? Why not just ignore the Ministry and set up an illegal Portkey (Dumbledore did it several times and nothing happened—do they even have a way to track this)? Why not have Moody transfigure Harry into a ferret and carry him in his pocket?

All of these ideas are explained by Harry's Trace; the Order knows the Ministry has been compromised, so somebody will be keeping an eye on him. The Ministry will know of any spells that are cast within Harry's vicinity and would be able to track a Portkey or Apparition.

As Moody says in The Seven Potters: ""We're going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can't detect, because we don't need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid's motorbike.""  The thing that pisses me off most was Hedwig. She's an owl. Why not send her to the Weasleys like three days before? Or have her fly there after? There was no reason whatsoever to have her go with them.  The problem is that Voldemort had to *know* about the plan, because it was important for Snape to be providing accurate intel."
The Top Comment on a Pizza Chain’s Post - Was not what I expected when I opened to see people’s answers 😂,2024-10-23 21:12:25,16794,27,0.5719,"I'm confused by the original post. What is Domino's going for?  Why didn’t Dumbledore just put Voldemort’s name in the goblet of fire?  Tomatoes when they're eaten by Denethor is my answer  My answer to that is always Tspiders  But no one is bothered by Snape simply saying ""Get out"" to Harry in OOTP mpvie when in the books he flings Harry around the room repeatedly yelling at the top of his voice while throwing potion bottles at him and Harry runs for his life out of Snapes office.  Did you put your nuts in the goblet of fire? I haven’t seen the movie  Always thought it made no sense that it’s a “binding magical contract” but someone else can put your name in??  Isn’t that forgery?  I mean…definitely started with a T. 😂  ^Calmly… ^not… ^quietly…  Took me a few seconds to realize that DYPYNITGOF - Did You Put Your Name In The Goblet of Fire"
"The scene in Chamber of Secrets when Mrs. Weasley tells Harry to eat hits way differently now. - The first time through, I just kind of interpreted it as Mrs. Weasley's general motherliness, in the same way a grandma will tell you you're too skinny after feeding you three giant helpings of food.

But rereading it, I realized that she wasn't just worrying over nothing, Harry had been starved for weeks. The Dursleys were giving him the bare minimum of food, and what they were giving him (like cold canned soup that was mostly broth) had no real nutritious value. Harry mentions that he had been spending most of his time lying around on his bed and sleeping, probably because he didn't have the energy to do much else.

The book describes Mrs. Weasley as being incredibly angry, right up until one of the twins mentions they had been starving Harry. When she then takes a second to actually see what bad shape Harry is in, almost all of the anger goes out of her. She's still a bit strict with the boys, but nowhere near as furious as she had been. We know Mrs. Weasley specialized in healing magic as well as cooking, and likely recognized all the signs of malnutrition in Harry. When she then monitors Harry as he's eating, and keeps giving him more, it's not a joke, it's because that's likely the first real meal he's had since he left Hogwarts.

Finally, during the conversation and meal, she makes a point of letting Harry know she's not angry with *him* when she starts yelling, and then constantly gives Harry praise and positive reinforcement. In short, she's following the textbook guide for dealing with victims of abuse, and getting them settled into a safer place.

I just thought it was a truly nice moment that showed an adult actually being responsible and caring for Harry's emotional and physical well being, something that he had only experienced once or twice previously.",2021-02-11 18:00:47,26923,114,0.9356,"I always think back to GOF when Harry's in the hospital wing after the maze and she hugs him deeply and he just lets loose and cries. Like he feels safe in her arms and cries as if she was his real mom without a care because he feels safe. That is one moment that always makes me cry. As a mom myself, our children are always supposed to feel safest in our arms.  It’s so awesome how she takes him in. It takes no time at all for the Wealseys to accept Harry as one of them, even though they don’t really have resources to spare. They love him so much, and Mrs. Weasley is absolutely perfect about it.  Can we talk about how Molly knit him his own sweater for Christmas in the first book, even though she'd only met him for like 5 seconds at King's Cross. Like Ron just casually mentions that Harry isn't expecting any gifts, and she's like 'nah, that won't do' and makes sure he has something to open Christmas morning.  Can I take a moment and pitch in Arthur, as well?

While Arthur has always seemed silly with his obsession over Muggle items, he always had faith in Harry. For instance, when he wanted to tell the truth about Sirius to Harry, or when he was more supportive of Sirius' desire to inform Harry about the work in the Order. 

And consider the fact that he had faith in Harry that even Dumbledore didn't possess, and he admitted it himself: *that Harry was more than ready to know the truth about himself and Voldemort*, back when he told Harry about the prophecy. 

You can see that behavior with his own sons, especially with Bill. Bill and Arthur's conversations always struck me as sounding more like a conversation between two colleagues, equals, than a father and son, because, while Molly can sometimes still regard her children, well... As *children* and be somewhat obsessive over small traits (like making Charlie get a haircut, despite him being an adult who already moved away across Europe for a job), Arthur recognizes the importance of recognizing and respecting his children as adults. He was the only one who didn't tease Percy for his overly flamboyant, opulent aura of faux sophistication, and respected him as an adult. 

He does the same with Harry. He never attempts to sugarcoat any subject with Harry, or infantilize him, and is very open to discuss anything about the world of wizards. He even took time to try and give a mini tour of the Ministry of Magic to Harry and explained the inner workings and functions, when Harry had his hearing. 

He perfectly balances out Molly. That's why they are such great parents.  Molly Weasley was a saint throughout the books.  Molly and Arthur are my favourite characters. Everything about the home they have created for their family screams love. If there was an open world Harry Potter game I would spend 50% of my time exploring the secrets of Hogwarts, and 50% of my time helping Molly with chores like tossing gnomes out the garden.  Such a good observation. I often wondered why Harry always had 2-3 helpings of her meals but, stupidly, it now dawns on me that he had spent most of the summer being starved. He wasn't shown to be particularly greedy at Hogwarts by comparison, unlike Ron! 😂  Yeah, as a parent now, any scene with Molly hits a little different. The thought of how mistreated Harry was by the Durselys is so distressing in general, but thinking of someone treating my kids like that gives me a visceral reaction when I read it. Feeding him through a cat flap, he’s not able to go to the bathroom when he needs it, and God knows how they treated him when he was a baby and too little to fight back even a little. 

In short: fuck Petunia and Vernon.  Lets just be grateful that JK didn’t kill Molly off  Molly Weasley knew Harry didn't have any real parental love growing up in his memories at least. So she took on the role of giving him what he needed."
"The thing I love most about Mcgonagall is that in the 5th book , when Umbridge was headmistress , she found Peeves unscrewing a chandelier and instead of stopping him , she told him it unscrews the other way . - What do you love most about her ?",2021-03-23 10:26:13,12852,116,0.8316,"'Potter,' she said in ringing tones, 'I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!'  - I teared up at this 

'— which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.' 'A very good chance, then,' said Professor McGonagall.   - the sass

'Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter belongs in my House!' Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him.

In general, I love how she's dignified, fierce, unquestionably loyal to Dumbledore, sassy, badass, proud, and I love her no-nonsense attitude.  It's one of my favorite character traits of McGonagall.  

She is very strict and proper in appearance, but she has a real rebellious side to her. She knows how to have a little fun, she deeply cares about her students, and she has a dry sense of humor.  “Do you want a cough syrup, Dolores?”

“Harry has obtained top marks in Defence against the dark arts exams set by a competent teacher”  Honestly, Harry and Ron’s first real introduction to McGonagall always stuck out when I think of her.

Ron : “That was bloody brilliant!”

Professor McGonagall : “Well, thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley. Perhaps it would be more useful if I were to transfigure Mr Potter and yourself into a pocket watch? That way, one of you might be on time.”

Harry : “We got lost.”

Professor McGonagall : “Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.”  ""The house of Godric Gryffindor has commanded the respect of the wizarding world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you, in the course of a single evening, besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons!"" 

Such a badass I love her  “I’ve found you a seeker.” She is still getting to know him, and yet gets him into the team.  Dame Maggie Smith. Most perfect of perfect casting choices.  I love how Minerva supports her students' careers. With her making sure Harry becomes an Auror in front of Umbridge, or when she support Neville taking classes of his choosing instead of what his grandma told him to.  I don't have the book in front of me, so forgive me if it's not word-for-word.  
McGonagall: (Is teaching)  
Umbridge: Hem hem.  
McGonagall: (Ignores her)  
Umbridge: I was just wondering if you'd received the time and date of your inspection.  
McGonagall: Obviously I received it, otherwise I would have asked what you were doing my classroom.  
McGonagall: (Keeps teaching)  
Umbridge: (Interrupts her again)  
McGonagall: I do not see how you expect to gain an understanding of how I teach, for, you see, I do not usually permit people to speak while I am speaking.  
Umbridge: (Shuts up for the entire rest of the class)  When Snape raised his wand at Harry in DH and McG pushes Harry aside to duel him herself. Gives me chills every time."

Philosopher's Stone: Harry suspects Snape a teacher, and instead it was Quirrell. So didn't suspect Malfoy and it wasn't a new mysterious teacher...

Chamber of Secrets: Suspects Malfoy, but it was Ginny/Malfoy's dad/Voldemort.

Prisoner of Azkaban: Suspects Sirius, but it was Peter Pettigrew.

Goblet of Fire: Sort of half suspects Karkaroff, but it was Barty Jr. disguised as the mysterious (but not dark) new teacher.

Order of the Phoenix: Doesn't really suspect anyone. Always clear that Umbridge and Voldemort are the main enemies.

Half Blood Prince: Suspects Malfoy and Snape, turns out to be Malfoy and Snape (and later revealed that the latter did it on Dumbledore's orders).

Deathly Hallows: Doesn't suspect anyone.  The way they gaslighted Harry on his sixth year. Lookin at you, Hermione  A quarter of the school's students have strong ties to wizard terrorists  This is only relevant TWICE:

Once cause Malfoys attitude that year.

The second one? Harry was right. Not sure why people act as if Harry is not right about people.  Um, no it doesn't. He suspects Malfoy twice in the entire series and he was right the second time  Tbf he was almost always right about Malfoy too.  Ever wonder how they took the Ministry over so quickly after finally accepting Voldemort showing back up? It was already completely infiltrated and corrupted, no new dark force necessary.  Harry Potter and the time it wasn't Snape
 
Harry Potter and the time it wasn't Malfoy
 
Harry Potter and the time it wasn't Sirius
 
Harry Potter and the time it wasn't Karkarov

Harry Potter and the time it was Malfoy and Snape
 
Harry Potter and the time it was Voldemort  Except the *one* year he kept insisting that Malfoy was up to something dastardly, and nobody believed him...and it was the *one* time that *he was right*.

Of course, Dumbledore already knew what Malfoy was up to and was letting it happen.  Dumbledore : brings tom to hogwart

Idk why, I found this funny.  No one loves Harry Potter as much as Tom Felton, lol.  19th anniversary, jfc I feel old  I feel like he’s the one who is best friends with everybody on set still which makes me feel very, very good  I suppose it’s like a high school reunion for a lot of the young actors especially as they did all their schooling etc on set as well. Not really mad to stay in contact with high school friends who may have stayed in the same business as you!  Can Rupert bring his Ice Cream truck?  I worked on a shoot a few years back as an extra and met Tom on set. He just started up a conversation with me, introduced himself and asked how I was doing, joked around a lot. He was really lovely and I’ll remember those few minutes for the rest of my life.  Tom Felton seems like a good guy.

Last year I was walking down a NYC subway platform (50th St, I think?). It was late, poor weather, and a weeknight, so the place was completely empty. Then I see two young guys - one taking a photo of the other - who was standing in front of a Jersey Boys poster with the widest grin and a joyfully enthusiastic thumbs up. He was scraggly and blonde and it made me pause and smile because - honestly I'd never seen someone so enthusiastic about Jersey Boys. I figured maybe he was a boy from Jersey and was amused by the poster - or maybe he was a young actor who had just been cast in the show.

It turns out it was not a boy from Jersey, but it was an actor. Tom Felton, who posted the photo on his Instagram the next day. And whose bright goofy smile caught my eye and stayed with me, even when I had no idea that he was not just a random boy on the subway platform.  Josh Gad recently did a great series on YouTube called ""ReUnited Apart"". They should reach out to him to help facilitate this."
"Voldemort got real creative when he was hiding the diadem - Lucius: “Where did you hide the locket, my lord?”  

Voldemort: “I put it at the bottom of a basin full of potion that you have to drink in order to get to it, but the potion makes you see and feel horrendous things, and also makes you crave water. The basin is on a small island in the middle of a dark lake, and the only water you can drink is from said lake. That lake is filled with a giant army of inferi which of course can only be stopped by fire. You can only get to the basin in the middle of the lake by taking a boat that’s hidden at the bottom, and you can only find the boat by pulling on an invisible chain. The lake is in a cavern protected by a door that is practically undetectable to the unsuspecting wizard. The door can only be opened if you cut yourself and splatter your blood on the door. Oh, and the door is inside a random cave that’s super hard to get to in the first place.”  

Lucius: “Incredible, my lord. It sounds nearly impossible for it to be discovered. And where did you hide the diadem?”  

Voldemort: “Lol I threw it in this random room I found at Hogwarts one time.”",2021-03-26 11:19:54,13566,107,-0.7278,"If you didn't know what you were looking for it would be like searching the proverbial needle in the haystack.

Edit: Actually now that I think about it. The fact that Voldemort hid it in the Room of Hidden Things was pretty brilliant. Most of the people didn't know what they were looking for or that they were even looking for a Horcrux.

What sits wrong with me is that Dumbledore never figured it out while Luna offered it as a suggestion immediately and most Ravenclaws knew about it. Considering that Dumbledore interrogated obscure people, Muggles, house elves about their encounter with Tom Riddle but never thought to ask Flitwick or the ghosts from his own school seems rather stupid. Even if the Grey Lady was not able to give Harry the exact location in the books, he could have still been able to find out that Tom Riddle asked about it at some point. Dumbledore was way better with words than Harry.  Voldemort thought he was the only one clever enough to have found the Room of Requirement  Am I the only person that feels like Voldemort hiding his horcruxes was like a parent? First one, super hidden, tons of traps and if you dare take it will kill you. Next one? Maybe some troll? Or even a dragon! Naaaaah, i will just throw it in the junk room  Clearly Slytherin's locket was his most prized horcrux and the only one he thought he really needed.  Dumbledore even tells Harry about how indifferent Voldemort was toward the diary as it was clearly meant as a weapon as well as to keep him alive.  I consider the safety of the horcruxes, in order of least protected to most protected, to be below.  

Harry - The unknown horcrux.  This is not even thought of as needing protection because Voldemort never suspects that Harry is a horcrux, even while ""killing"" the piece of soul within Harry.  So, I can't rank how this would actually fall as we can only suspect how Voldemort would have handled the situation if he knew.  I guess he still would have killed Harry, destroying the horcrux in the process, deciding the loss of a part of his soul was worth it to solidify his domination of the magical world.

The Diary - The least protected horcrux.  This was left in the care of Lucius and was intended to be used as a weapon to bring about the basilisk again and weaken Dumbledore/Hogwarts for Voldemort's eventual takeover.  

Nagini - Another weapon horcrux.  This one is used by Voldemort to carry out missions.  I rank this one higher than the Diary because Voldemort does not entrust Nagini to anyone else's care.  She is always connected to him, even out on missions, and he is most aware of her existence at all times out of all of the horcruxes.

The Ring - buried in some dirt in the floor of his families shack of a house. The ring has a curse on it that will kill someone who wears it.  Definitely not very protected for something that is supposed to house a piece of a person's soul.

The Diadem - I consider this the third most protected horcrux.  Although Voldemort was the world's biggest idiot to believe no one else had discovered the Room of Requirement and never learned of it's true potential, there were tons of piles of stuff in the room to make it lss likely anyone would find and take the diadem or destroy it.  This is much less protected than the Cup as many people have access to the room of requirement compared to a high security Gringott's vault that the owners knew the diadem was Voldemort's and wouldn't touch it.  The chances of a random student finding the diadem in the room of requirement, taking a liking too it, discovering that it is Ravenclaw's lost diadem, and someone eventually discovering what it had become are higher.  Only the shear amount of items that are also in the room to hide the diadem from discovery make this safer than the ring in my opinion.  

Hufflepuff's Cup - left in Bellatrix's high security vault at Gringott's.  I would say this is the second most protected horcrux.  It is very unlikely that anyone would be able to get into the vault and steal it.  At the same time, if a LeStrange who had access to the vault discovered what it was and wanted to turn on Voldemort, they could easily access this.  Putting a horcrux in the care of a Death Eater is pretty careless for Voldemort who trusts and relies on no one.

The locket - as said in the post, very well protected and really the only one to be so protected.  

Given this information, I really think that the locket is the only horcrux Voldemort really cares about.  As the only living descendent of Slytherin, he sees it as his rightful heirloom and proves his connection to who he sees as the greatest wizard in history and a validation of his right to become even greater and rule over the world, both magical and muggle.  The rest are neat, powerful artifacts, many of which are associated with Hogwarts founders, who he has a great respect for.  As you can see, the other most protected horcruxes are Hufflepuff's and Ravenclaw's heirlooms.  I would suspect that if he had Gryffindor's sword, he would have turned it into a horcrux and protected it as much as Hufflepuff's cup or slightly more to put it in second place.  Maybe he even intended to make it into a horcrux with Harry's death, had Harry, Ron, and Hermione not ""stolen"" it from the vault with the cup.  Voldemort: Lucius, you will guard one of my precious horrocruxes. Protect it with your live.

*Lucius years later puts the horrocrux inside another book of a first year hogwarts student*  Yeah Voldemort's whole Horcrux plan was fucked. By choosing objects of great significance and hiding them in places relevant to his upbringing, he pretty much put the Horcrux hunt on easy mode for Dumbledore/Harry (I mean, it was still difficult, but definitely a lot easier than it could've been). I know that's the whole point because it's showing how egotistical he is, but c'mon Voldy, you could've done a couple random ones just to be safe.  Ted Bundy once said something like “you plan your first horcrux to the letter, but by your fifth horcrux you’re like ‘where’d I put the giant snake again?’”  Reading the cave scene made me think about how all the people I know carry water bottles and how fucked Voldemort's plan would have been if Harry prepared and brought a Nalgene  It also makes no sense that he chose the Room of Hidden Things to hide it. We know from Voldemort's thoughts in DH that he thought he was the only student to ever find the place. Where the Hell did he think all of the stuff in the Room of Hidden Things came from if not other students? Harry even describes the Room of Hidden Things as containing ""the contraband of generations of students"" later in the same book. Heck, how did the Vanishing Cabinet that was a twin to the one in Borgin and Burkes get there if not placed there by someone? Surely, Draco would have told someone his plan and they would have in turn told Voldemort.

Did Voldemort take a single look at the room and assumed it was where Vanished things go or something?  I read this like it was Yzma’s plot to kill Kuzco from Emperor’s New Groove"

Wow... thats a 24 hours  Well he didn’t pee in any of the 7 books either   Haha omg I will keep that in mind next re-read"
"Why Did the Half-Blood Prince Film Add That Train Station Flirtation? - In *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, Harry shares a flirty moment with a waitress at Surbiton Station, he even asked her out—a scene absent from the books. Considering his growing feelings for Ginny Weasley, what was the point of this addition?",2025-01-05 14:44:15,16059,265,0.7622,"[deleted]  i think it was just to show that harry had normal teenage boy thoughts, and getting noticed by an attractive girl is exciting, but alas when dumbledore shows up, and he has to immediately leave, the sad look on harrys face as he sees her searching for him, it’s like he knows “normal” will never be part of his life…  To show that Harry was a Rizzard  I think the director was just trying to show the audience that Harry was ""maturing"". Since Harry's feelings for Ginny have never been included in the plot, showing intimacy with Ginny was probably considered to be more random than that.  I thought it showed a couple of things for me - a) prelude to scenes with Ginny; 2) no matter how much Harry tries to escape his reality with mundane stuff or get his mind off of things, it's just not possible for him  They had more chemistry than Harry & Ginny  

This girl shared more on screen chemistry with him than Ginny Weasley did in the movies.  So we could see Harry get cock blocked by Dumbledore?  This scene replaces a better and more important scene between Dumbledore and the Dursleys. It also omits key plot elements regarding Kreacher. It was another huge disappointment for me.  What growing feelings for Ginny? They cut all of that from the films"
"Would the last scene of the film series be better if it brought back the cozy tone of the first two movies? - I understand the series got darker as it went along but it bothered me a bit when the tone still looked gray in the final scene. I would have liked it if the ending returned to the same warmth as the first two films. Voldemort was gone so it wouldn't have been as dark of a period. It would have reminded us more of the final scene of the Philosopher's Stone, especially because they both use the same music score. Does anyone agree?",2024-08-02 22:32:03,12488,198,0.8836,"At least they wouldn't look like corpses. Basically every movie from OotP on hits grayer and grayer scales until they all literally look like they're wax people.  Throughout the entire movie, direct sunlight is nowhere to be found *until* the moment Voldemort died. That, I believe, is when the color and warmth should have come back as well.  They were too literal with the movies getting darker  The first two movies hit different for a reason. Not only were they (in my opinion) the most accurate to the books, they were also the most warm and cozy of the series.  Yeah, I suppose so. That scene was meant to parallel the first book

1. Just like Ginny, Lily wants to go to Hogwarts early.   
2. Just like Harry, Albus doesn’t want to be in Slytherin.   
3. Similar to Fred and George, James Sirius liked joking around.   
4. Draco, Harry, Hermione, Ron and Ginny are altogether on the platform with their respective children. Scorpius appears to be meeting the others for the first time. (Which would later be confirmed in Cursed Child.)

5. Vernon didn’t want to leave Harry alone in The House because he was afraid the house would be destroyed and Harry tells James that he won’t let him share a room  with Albus due to them getting the house demolished.  I always found it weird how grey everything looked at the final scene tbh.  If you prefer the warmer tones, you guys should check out my edits of Harry potter (the Magical edition) it's a passion project of mine on youtube: [first episode of the youtube series.](https://youtu.be/hKlcKK_NKWk?feature=shared)
I talk about my edits of the films. I make the later film of the franchise more magical and consistent by color grading them, adding the music composed by John Williams for the first 3 films for more musical consistency and more.  [deleted]  This actually perfectly validates my dislike with the style of these films. Every time i mention the lack of color or dark/cloudy scenery, i always get “iTs SuPpOsEd To Be DaRkEr” because of the war/voldemort but this right here shows that that’s a bs response  I'll be honest, I'm just OVER blue filter, even when it's artistically suited to the story being told. It's not going to hurt a dark story to be displayed in full colour."
“Dark times lie ahead of us and there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right.” - Some relevant quotes from Albus Dumbledore.,2020-06-02 14:01:58,21713,29,0.4404,"“It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it.”  Harry: ""I wish it need not have happened in my time.""

Dumbledore: ""So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we—wait.....""  [deleted]  All quotes from Dumbledore are relevant at all times.  Gonna make some coffee and delve in to a late night Harry Potter reading session to escape this shitty world.  THE MINISTRY HAS FALLEN.  All of Dumbledore’s quotes from book 4 onwards are relevant as hell these days. 

This one too: “Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!”

We are striking back.  “We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided”  It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.  I watched Order of the Phoenix yesterday. The parallels are astounding. I cried multiple times. The sense of dread of what’s to come was overwhelming."
