# Harry-Potter-SubReddit-Sentiment-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis and sentiment analysis on Harry Potter Subreddit data using Python and the Reddit PRAW API.

This project uses the Reddit API to extract, clean, and analyze Reddit post and comment data for exploratory data analysis and sentiment analysis. The analysis demonstrates data collection via authenticated API access, text processing, and visual storytelling using R, making it a practical resource for those learning API-based data workflows in R.

The key insights and visualizations from this analysis are available in the Harry Potter Subreddit Analysis.pdf included in this repository.
