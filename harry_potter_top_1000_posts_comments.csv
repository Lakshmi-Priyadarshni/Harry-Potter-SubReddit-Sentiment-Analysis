I mean, look at it: 

James Sirius: Harrys Dad, whome Ginny never met; Harrys Godfather, whome Ginny did know a bit, but as far as we know was not especially close or anything. 

Albus Severus: 1. The old guy Harry thought he was super close with. Ginny surely admired Dumbledore, too, but we have no indication that she had any special connection to him, other than being a Hogwarts student and a member of the resistance that has him as leader/figure head; 2. The guy that every Gryffindor student totally hated. The guy that killed Dumbledore. That was the figure head of the horrible regime at Hogwarts during the 7th book, when Ginny actually was at Hogwarts and suffered under said regime. The guy that aparently was into Harrys mom, and as a result was in a position where Dumbledore could manipulate him into doing stuff that protected Harry for as long as Dumbledore needed him to survive.  Even if the last thing makes Snape a hero in Harrys eyes, why would Ginny consent to Snape being honored that way?

Lily Luna: Harrys mom, whome Ginny never met. And a girl that was a friend of Harry, and a good friend of Ginny. 

Even ignoring that Harry somehow decided to honor Dumbledore and Snape, but not e.g. Lupin or Hagrid: Looks to me like the only time where Ginny was able to honor someone important to *her* was the second name of her third child. Ever other name choice had little personal connection to her, or in case of Severus honored someone she had good reasons to resent. While Harry got to honor both his parents, his godfather, his two ""heroes"" and someome he is friends with. Even Luna, the one person honored that is closer to Ginny than to him, is someone he is close with, too.",119,2020-10-28 11:31:21,0.9962

>!Harry's younger son, Albus, and Draco's son Scorpius are besties in Slytherin together. Also, nobody likes them and they get bullied a lot. At some point, Harry and Albus have a big fight over Albus being so unrelatable, and Albus spills a potion on Harry's baby blanket (this is important). Later, the boys meet a weird girl, named Delphi, who was homeschooled and never went to Hogwarts. Albus has the hots for her. She's taking care of Cedric's dad, who asks Harry to use time travel to save his son. Harry says no, which Albus thinks is crappy since he partly blames his dad for Cedric's death.!<

>!While on the way to school, the 2 boys jump off the train after a traintop fight scene with the candy lady train gremlin. They scoop up Delphi and sneak into the Ministry, which is run by Minister Hermione. Albus is using Polyjuice to run interference as Ron while Scorpius is snooping in her office. They're looking for a special Time Turner, which had previously been confiscated by the Ministry. Hermione demands to be let in and Albus kisses her to buy time and distract her. It's... honestly more cringey than gross. üòë!<

>!They get their hands on the special Time Turner, a powerful beta model made for Draco to save his dead wife. They use it to go back in time and try to save Cedric's life. They have to make a couple attempts but they keep botching it up, creating bizarre alternate futures. One of their attempts leads to them accidentally allowing Voldemort to win the war. Albus temporarily disappears and Scorpius meets living future Snape, who is a leading member of the failing resistance. He helps send Scorpius back in time to fix things, knowing he, himself, will die in that timeline. What a G. ü´°!<

>!At some point in the story, there's a moment when everybody is super worried about where the kids are and Ginny tells Harry to bring back her son or don't come home. ‚ò†Ô∏è Also, Harry speaks to Dumbledore's portrait, which cries because he's also worried and because he fears having his name might be adding extra pressure to the boy. It's super weird.!<

>!After returning things to normal, the boys are freaked out by everything that happened and decide to break the Time Turner, but Delphi doesn't want that. They realize that Delphi was one of the evil figures in the twisted timeline Scorpius saw. They confront her, and time travel shenanigans ensue. She leaves them all stranded in the past with no way to return. They realize they're trapped sometime just prior to when Voldemort kills Harry's parents. The boys sneak into the Potters' house and leave a message on Harry's blanket. They hope Harry will find it in the present so he can rescue them.!<

>!Separately, the adults realize who the girl is, and Harry finds the message. They also realize that Draco has the finalized version of the special Time Turner. Around this time, it's revealed that Delphi is actually... sit down for this... the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix. Apparently, Voldy was not above making a pure(ish) heir, and this child was born not long before the end of book 7. She was raised by surviving Death Eaters, who filled her head with evil propaganda, as well as hid her true identity from the world.!<

>!All the adults (including Draco) pile into the turbo Time Turner to go back and save the kids and stop the girl. They end up at Godric's Hollow on the night Voldemort kills Harry's parents. Delphi was waiting nearby so she could meet her future father and become Azula to his Ozai. But Harry turns into Voldemort and traps her. She loses her crap over it.

Based on what we've already seen, the big moments of such a movie have already been shown: Snape begging Dumbledore to protect them. Then Snape going into the ruined house to find Lily's body. Snape talking with Dumbledore about the aftermath. The scene at the end of DH wraps that all up pretty neatly.

His motivations are based out of a super unhealthy love obsession, so despite the books/movies attempts to make him into some sort of hero, he was really quite selfish in the end. Empathizable on the surface, but much less so when you dig past that first layer.

I'm not saying he sucks as a character, just that, given what we already have been shown in the movie, there's nothing *new* that would fill an entire movie script properly.",38,2021-12-28 02:53:25,0.9626

From an outside perspective, Harry seriously comes across as such a jock, BUT people are constantly commenting on the ‚Äúmodesty they‚Äôve heard about‚Äù when they meet him. And as the books are written from Harry‚Äôs POV 99.9% of the time, constantly citing his thoughts, internal discussions, etc., it is clear that he is literally one of the most humble people in the world. With everything he has going for him. Anybody else in his shoes would *constantly* be thinking about how others perceive them as great (See Gilderoy Lockhart for an exaggerated idea).

**Can you imagine how the narrative for the books would sound if Harry had [Gilderoy‚Äôs self obsessed mind](https://youtu.be/O9UsSSgndzo)**

Edit:

‚ÄúEverybody in the common room was staring at him, fixated on his every word. And yet, Harry‚Äôs head felt hot. He had just noticed a small first year boy in the back who seemed to have more interest in his hideous cherry-black wand than Harry Potter‚Äôs personal account of the death of his parents. He could not believe that the little twit had the audacity. 

Perhaps, Harry wondered, he did not know who was speaking. Maybe the boy came from a muggle family and was not yet familiar with the most important figure in wizarding culture. Yes, Harry concluded. The boy is simply ignorant; It would be kind to approach him later and fill him in on the story.

I mean, Snape literally left a puzzle in his alcohol room. Why do that at all? Just fill the entire room with identical bottles of liquid, and only Dumbledore and Snape would know which one is the ""safe"" bottle. Every other bottle is poison.

OR, just put 9 different doors each protected by a password by a different teacher. Only Dumbledore would know all the passwords.

Surely that's a lot more secure than making a Wizard play chess to go through?

Hell Dumbledore could've picked a random house (anyone from the order could've helped), hid the stone there and put a Fidelius Charm on it.

Michael Gambon's Dumbledore felt like the reverse if anything. but while watching the movies, I think a good part of that responsibility lies with the director and script writer too.

Quirrel wanted to take the stone for Voldemort to use.  
So the Mirror understands transitive properties of use.

This means that if Nicholas Flamel had been like,   
""Hey Dumbledore! Please get me the stone so I can make some more elixer of life!""

Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to get the stone.  
And Dumbledore couldn't directly send anyone else to get the stone, becasue they would be trying to take it under the premise that Dumbledore wants it to be used.  
Infact, the only person that could possibly take the stone would be someone:

1) Rich enough to not care about gold.  
2) Young enough to not care about their mortality.  
3) Dumb enough to try and get it soley to prevent Voldemort from getting it.

Harry is literally the only person that could have done it.

While he had found them quite lacking in charms, potions or spells, Hermione behaved as if the Professor had exposed her to another dimension, but one from which he seemed to be excluded, having not the first idea what the dialectical method was, nor how it shaped the progress of history. Sensing that he needed to bridge the growing chasm between them, he resolved to interrogate her about the subject at supper.
> 
> In the Great Hall, amidst the usual chatter and hubbub, he found Hermione seated across from Ron, yet the sense endured that she was utterly alone as she quietly leafed through a pile of books that floated all around her, taking diligent notes. Ron, meanwhile, wore a face like thunder, as he angrily shovelled food into his mouth, chewing as loudly and as ostentatiously as possible, though Hermione seemed oblivious to his provocations.
> 
> Seeing his approaching form out of the corner of her eye, Hermione snapped ""I'm busy Harry! Can't you see I'm working?""
> 
> ""Well, the thing is.."" said Harry, thinking quickly, ""I'm doing a survey, it won't take long.. And I'll get into awful trouble if I don't get enough responses!""
> 
> Hermione sighed loudly and turned to face him, and Ron stopped chewing quite so boisterously in order to listen.
> 
> ""What's your least favourite class?"" Harry asked, having decided to start with a soft lob of a question, hoping that answer would lead to question, would lead to answer and a conversation would crystallise between them.
> 
> ""The Bourgeoisie!"" spat Hermione ""Because they control the means of production!""
> 
> ""Poppycock!"" exploded Ron, ""It is the Communists‚Äô intention to make people think that personal success is somehow achieved at the expense of others and that every successful man has hurt somebody by becoming successful. It is the Communists‚Äô aim to discourage all personal effort and to drive men into a hopeless, dispirited, grey herd of robots who have lost all personal ambition, who are easy to rule, willing to obey and willing to exist in selfless servitude to the State.""
> 
> For the first time, Harry sensed the dialectical method at work, though he worried that it seemed to have arrived at a standstill, with the prospect of synthesis between his arguing friends an ever diminishing hope. Somewhere in the wild, distant reaches of his mind, a thought occurred that seemed like it might repair the bridge that had once stood so stalwartly between them, even though they now argued back and forth with such ferocity that Harry could barely keep track of what the disagreement was actually about. However, no sooner than a question had begun to form itself on Harry's lips, Ron unleashed another rhetorical salvo in Hermione's direction:
> 
> ""'Public welfare' is the welfare of those who do not earn it; those who do, are entitled to no welfare.""
> 
> ""It‚Äôs people like you, Ron, who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they‚Äôre too lazy to ‚Äî"" At that moment, there was a loud bang, as Harry slammed his fist on the table.
> 
> ""Enough!"" he cried.",518,2017-12-18 10:19:43,-0.7956

Do you agree?,,2021-06-01 13:50:24,32624,95,0.3612,"I've always seen your house as a reflection of what you value, not what you are.

Examples:
Hermione being wicked smart but saying ""Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery"". And despite Pettigrew being a cowardice lard, what he admired most in his friends was their courage and strength. Lockhart was a blundering idiot but he dreamed of being the cleverest wizard to have ever lived. Digory was wicked talented and incredibly brave but he valued humility and kindness. Luna could have easily been a hufflepuff where her weirdness and kindness would have been embraced but she valued curiosity and asking questions other people didn't want to answer. The list goes on and on.

Edit: to add more examples by request.
Slughorn is an easy example as he is not overtly ambitious himself but actively surrounds himself with ambitious people to cushion his more private lifestyle. Draco's a more subtle example because you don't get to glimpse another possible house for him until late in the series when he's facing a wandless Dumbledore and realizing that maybe he doesn't have to kill him. This moment, for me, shows the difference between Draco imitating his childhood heros who were powerfully evil and the wizard he could have been if he didn't value power over everything else. Neville found his courage and embodied what it means to be griffindor but he started by first admiring the courage of his parents (whose bitter consequences might have slowed Neville's own willingness to be brave). And finally: Order of Merlin-First class, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, Albus Dumbledore. A man absolutely overflowing with magical talent, a lifelong pursuer of knowledge, a teacher that went out of his way to include every student, and a man so deviously strategic he masterminded the fall of an un-nameably vicious dark wizard by manipulating a teenager. This man is a Griffindor, not because he ever showed courage, not because he surrounded himself with brave people, no. This man's life long obsession with the power that love lends is what put him in Griffindor. The courage that loving brings, the strength. Perhaps fueled by his own desperate inability to save the sister he loved too passively to protect. But, I digress.

He was really ambitious and cunning. Doing whatever it took to get fame. A Slytherin Trait. So he was an ambitious Ravenclaw rather than a stupid one.

Slughorn's doesn't fit him very well but I can't find any replacement word for it.

Lockhart was not Stupid.  His scheme of mind wiping and taking credit for others adventures took some effort. Perhaps a better word would be manipulative,  not sure.   And it is Ravenclaw.

Not sure you would call Slughorn kind.  He was not evil,  not bent on power and the like but he could be uncarring towards those he deemed lesser.  He was in the end brave and loyal and one of the few Slytherin who fought against Voldemort and the Death Eaters.

Which one was better?,,2024-07-04 05:06:06,29571,169,0.4404,"Voldemort's death in the book is much better because it falls much more in line with the overall themes and story of the series.

- Voldemort is very deliberately described as just falling down flat on his back. This is to reinforce that behind the power and mystique of He Who Must Be Not Be Named The Dark Lord Lord Voldemort he's really just another mortal man named Tom who falls down dead when he gets hit by a killing curse.  
- Voldemort's failure to properly track the lineage of the Elder Wand speaks to his warped perspectives of power and this ultimately causes his downfall. Voldemort never considered that 'defeating' somebody could mean anything other than killing them - Harry knows better and knows that there are ways to defeat people without killing them and so he understands the lineage of the Elder Wand, which turns out to be crucial.  
- The fact that Voldemort's final spell is a killing curse and Harry's is a disarming spell is important as it reinforces how Harry values the lives of other people, whereas Voldemort has never seen other people as anything other than disposable. Harry and Lupin have a heated argument earlier in the book about Harry's continued use of disarming spells in life or death situations, but Harry stays true to his convictions even when facing down Voldemort.  
- Harry and Voldemort don't need to engage in a big epic battle because Harry has already won before anyone fires a spell. His ability to inspire others not through fear but through courage leads the Hogwarts to defeat the Death Eaters completely, and the magical protection that Harry gave them through his sacrifice wins out.

reading the discussion, here a few thoughts:

\- Yup, Victor Hugo is my real name! Actually it is Victor Hugo Queiroz, but Queiroz is tricky to pronounce in some languages so I almost don't use it. (My dad was reading Les Miserables when my mom was pregnant)

\- I do a lot of fanarts in my spare time, usually related to comics and games! Some of my fanarts became ""official"" like some comic cover arts that I did for Marvel! (YAAY!)

\- I noticed that I misspelled Elfish a couple of days after posting the illustration, but I was like ""well, next time I need to check it twice""

\- This one was made in 3ds Max (and a bunch of other Softwares), and a fun fact is that I'm not a good 2d artist, so the painting behind Hermione is also a 3D illustration with some faked oil paint strokes. ;)

On the other hand, several Harry's running away made Deatheaters instantly focus on chasing them, splitting up in the process. Which made them less dangerous than they were in the group. For members of the Order, it was part of a plan, so they made into groups with people that they work well.

They didnt really do much better with the Durmstrang students either, their ""introduction"" is equally annoying in my mind. 

But the beauxbaton's are really strange. While the Hogwart students look their age mostly, the beauxbatons look all like 20+ models. The books, as far as I recall, dont say they are *all* gorgeous, just Fleur. And I believe there are male students from that school that come to Hogwarts too.

* She's not fazed by being attacked by Pixies in Professor Lockharts classroom, even though she probably never met one before since learning about magic less than two years before that. She refers to the experience as ""hands-on experience"", after using a Clever Freezing charm.

* Her speciality was conjuring up portable, waterproof fires like a pyromaniac.

* She has grown up with non-magical parents, but is really smart... Obsessively smart about magic. Almost like she appreciates it most. Hagrid mentions that there's no spell that she can't do yet. 

So, IMO she's probably closer to a really smart council-estate raised girl who cherishes this newly found magic existence than a posh meek higher class girl like she's portrayed to be.

Some things will never translate well to screen, no matter how much time you have. We don't *need* every detail - we already have the books. Back in the coronavirus lockdown, I sat down and mapped out how it could work, each episode being app. 1 hour. This way, the majority of details from the books are included, without being ridiculous.

Transport is free unless they take the knight bus (rare occurrence). Only thing left would be food, clothing, school materials, some amount of housewares as needed? As stated here, food can be stretched with duplication charms plus the weasleys are stated as having a decent garden and some livestock. Everyone gets everyone else's repaired hand me downs. I don't get it lol. 

Side note some people are like ""Arthur's head of a department"" but we can safely assume based on wizard prejudices that the muggle shit department was not well funded or paid (only 2 or 3 people I think?) so we can safely assume his income is absolute dog shit til he gets a promotion in book 6",269,2024-04-10 17:41:28,-0.7431

Making it rain,,2024-04-10 16:05:26,27002,86,0.0,"Hmm‚Ä¶ thinking about their expenses, I‚Äôve come up with this list:

-	Food. As we know duplication is possible, presumably they only need to prepare enough food for one person at a time and can stretch that for the rest of the family.
-	Taxes. It‚Äôs probably safe to assume the MoM charges income tax, property tax, etc. similarly to Muggle governments. It must receive funding from somewhere after all, and considering how small the Wizarding population is and how many people and services the MoM supports, it seems likely these taxes are rather high.
-	Transportation, probably mostly Floo powder. Molly and Arthur can Apparate, but the kids can‚Äôt, and Floo powder seems to be the primary form of transportation under these circumstances. It‚Äôs probably safe to assume Floo powder cannot be duplicated; else it wouldn‚Äôt be economically viable.
-	Clothing. Despite a heavy reliance on hand-me-downs, clothes don‚Äôt last forever.
-	School supplies
-	Stationery (quills, ink, parchment, etc.)
-	Books
-	Daily Prophet subscription, although IIRC this is extremely cheap

We don‚Äôt know if the Weasleys have any debts. I feel like it‚Äôs safe to assume that things like mortgages and lines of credit exist in the Wizarding world, though we never see them which makes it difficult to speculate what the Weasleys might have.

We do know Arthur was fined 50 galleons in CoS, and that as of earlier that same year, their vault contained only 1 galleon, which was used to pay for school supplies (and thanks to Lockhart, the supplies list was far more expensive than usual). This seems to imply there‚Äôs no way he could afford the fine. Thankfully, they won a 700 galleon prize in PoA, and while some of it was spent on a trip to Egypt, I feel like it‚Äôs safe to assume they also paid down some debts with this money.

In terms of income, Arthur is the sole worker, and while he is head of a department, it is one that is sidelined due to prejudices. It‚Äôs therefore likely that, after taxes, he isn‚Äôt taking much home.

And like in the Muggle world, wages presumably correlate with cost of living. That means it‚Äôs probably safe to assume that the median wage is much lower than in the Muggle world as the cost of living is also lower (no utilities, food can be duplicated, etc.).

For those who speculate that Molly doesn‚Äôt work, I think the reality couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Presumably she does most of the chores, tending to the livestock and vegetables when the kids aren‚Äôt home, de-gnoming the garden, etc. She also does the cooking, which requires skill despite being assisted by magic. And until CoS, she also presumably homeschooled the younger kids while the older ones were away at Hogwarts.",40,2024-04-10 19:24:21,0.9913

The scene in Chamber of Secrets when Mrs. Weasley tells Harry to eat hits way differently now.,"The first time through, I just kind of interpreted it as Mrs. Weasley's general motherliness, in the same way a grandma will tell you you're too skinny after feeding you three giant helpings of food.

When she then monitors Harry as he's eating, and keeps giving him more, it's not a joke, it's because that's likely the first real meal he's had since he left Hogwarts.

While Arthur has always seemed silly with his obsession over Muggle items, he always had faith in Harry. For instance, when he wanted to tell the truth about Sirius to Harry, or when he was more supportive of Sirius' desire to inform Harry about the work in the Order. 

And consider the fact that he had faith in Harry that even Dumbledore didn't possess, and he admitted it himself: *that Harry was more than ready to know the truth about himself and Voldemort*, back when he told Harry about the prophecy. 

You can see that behavior with his own sons, especially with Bill. Bill and Arthur's conversations always struck me as sounding more like a conversation between two colleagues, equals, than a father and son, because, while Molly can sometimes still regard her children, well... As *children* and be somewhat obsessive over small traits (like making Charlie get a haircut, despite him being an adult who already moved away across Europe for a job), Arthur recognizes the importance of recognizing and respecting his children as adults. He was the only one who didn't tease Percy for his overly flamboyant, opulent aura of faux sophistication, and respected him as an adult. 

He does the same with Harry. He never attempts to sugarcoat any subject with Harry, or infantilize him, and is very open to discuss anything about the world of wizards. He even took time to try and give a mini tour of the Ministry of Magic to Harry and explained the inner workings and functions, when Harry had his hearing.

This is why Neville was sorted into Gryffindor in his first year. We all know he has a lot of grit and courage by 6th and 7th year, but you have to admit that first year Neville is scared of *everything*- but he WANTS to be courageous. Hermione is in a similar camp. She's incredibly booksmart and sticks to the rules, so she would fit in Ravenclaw, right? Well, in Hermione's own words, books and cleverness don't matter to her as much as courage and loyalty.

It's very similar to taking their choice into account, but not quite the same thing I think 

Edit: this is only loosely related, but while I'm on the topic, I remember a post made recently about Percy and why he belonged in Slytherin and not Gryffindor. I think the value-based-sorting applies here, too. Percy was very ambitious, but I think he was still more courageous than ambitious for his entire arc. It takes a lot of guts to stand up to your family for what you believe in. It just so happened that Percy believed in the Ministry of Magic more than he believed in Dumbledore. I think it's easy to see his sycophant attitude and assume that he's only acting a certain way in order to climb the ranks in the Ministry (to he specific, denouncing Harry and Dumbledore, supporting Umbridge's reign, etc). But in the other hand, if he truly believes in what he's doing, can you see how that would take a lot of courage to stand up to what you were raised to believe, to stand up to your whole family?",169,2020-06-08 12:38:11,0.9964

But I also worked in a bookstore for a year after high school and when HBP got released, I remember being given the stink eye by my church peers for ‚Äúselling a work of Satan‚Äù. 

In 2007, when DH came out, I attended university a few towns over and like many of you, went to the midnight launch to get my copy. By then I wasn‚Äôt involved in church as much and was REALLY excited to see how the series would end. I even dresses up for the occasion.

Then, lo and behold: there are my former church peers, all at the launch. What joy to see that they had turned around on their whole Harry Potter witchcraft crap. 

But I was wrong. It was a a prayer vigil. They said the only thing they would be reading, is is the Bible. 

So yeah, the whole Harry Potter being Satanic thing was very real.

I had a great relationship with both my step parents and it got better and better as life went on, but growing up there was the odd clash. They could be assholes, I was particularly good at being an asshole too - but we'd always default to really trying to make it work, and there'd be gestures like this one that clearly showed me they cared about me and my siblings.

After speaking openly about this stuff with my step parents as an adult, one thing I've always wished to go back and change is to express more clearly how much I appreciated it when they'd go all out like you have done here to do something really special and personally meaningful for me. The fact they had to wonder about that throughout those teenage years is a shame because the appreciation was always there. I'd always thought they knew, but of course as a kid or a teenager I hadn't exactly put it into words and it was only many years later I could make sure they understood in hindsight.

I'm not assuming anything - it's just as likely your kid is a much better communicator than we all were back in the day... But just in case the recollections of a random Internet stranger can help one dedicated stepparent out there to avoid a smidgeon of the ""am I don't it right?""s then there it is.

There was (using character names because I‚Äôm terrible with actor names):
Ron
Cho Chang
Neville
Luna
(I think Ginny?)

Everyone besides Luna kinda crapped on the Harry Potter movies. When asked about their thoughts on the movies, they all responded with variations of ‚Äúwell, they were ok to get my foot in the door, but I don‚Äôt want to be associated with them going forward.‚Äù

And the whole session was just them talking about how they wanted people to basically forget about the HP movies and ‚Äútake them seriously‚Äù like the HP movies weren‚Äôt serious acting.

Luna was excellent. She always has been one of the biggest potterheads around and she stuck up for the movies and their impact and importance. But it just disappointed me that all of those particular actors were on that stage because of HP movies and they were essentially telling fans that these movies were sub-par in their opinion.

Mission impossible,,2024-03-15 14:06:08,24540,132,0.0,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood in the Room of Requirement, the Nokia phone horcrux lying innocently on a wooden table. They had tried spells, potions, and even the Sword of Gryffindor, but the phone remained unscathed.

""Let's try the Basilisk fang again,"" Hermione suggested, her voice tinged with frustration.

Ron, looking more disheveled than usual, nodded in agreement. ""It has to work. It's destroyed other horcruxes!""

Harry carefully picked up the fang and with a determined cry, he stabbed the Nokia phone. The fang snapped upon impact, leaving the phone without a single scratch.

""Blimey, it's like trying to destroy a boulder with a toothpick,"" Ron exclaimed, throwing his hands up in defeat.

Hermione, ever the thinker, paced back and forth. ""There must be something we're missing. Nokia phones are tough, but there has to be a way to break it.""

The trio spent hours experimenting with different methods. They tried dropping it from great heights, submerging it in water, and even feeding it to a hungry dragon. Yet, the Nokia phone horcrux remained, gleaming with a mocking shine.

As night fell, they sat around the phone, their faces illuminated by its faint, magical glow. It was then that Harry had an epiphany.

""Guys, what if we're going about this all wrong? What if... we need to destroy it from the inside?""

Ron's eyes widened. ""You mean...""

""Yes,"" Harry said, a spark of hope in his voice. ""We hack it.""

And so, they embarked on a quest to learn the ancient art of muggle hacking. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. They consulted with the best muggle-born hackers, delved into the deepest corners of the internet, and even sought the help of the Weasley twins.

But the Nokia phone horcrux was built in an era before smart technology. Its defenses were simple yet impenetrable. No spell, no potion, no muggle trickery could breach its shell.

In the end, the trio had to accept that some dark magic was too powerful to overcome. The Nokia phone horcrux had defeated them, not by force, but by its sheer, unyielding nature.

As they left the Room of Requirement, the phone buzzed to life, its screen displaying a message that sent chills down their spines:

""Horcrux 1 - Wizards 0.""

I love how beautiful it is, but, in my experience, it doesn‚Äôt make a great bookmark. The top part is so heavy compared to the rest, that it easily fell out of the book I was reading. I usually read paperbacks, so that probably contributed to my problems.   
    
I now have it proudly displayed in our Geeky Items Collection area (along with my Star Trek, Doctor Who, other Harry Potter, and Tamora Pierce stuff). I use the subscription cards that fall out of magazines as bookmarks, most of the time. They keep my pages better.   
    
If you choose to use them, try it out on a hardback book. It may work better.

Honestly, I always understood where Sirius was coming from with his need to get out of the house and his anger that he wasn't able to and that he really wasn't a useful entity in the Order and that he couldn't even help protect Harry, etc.

It wasn't just the year stuck in a house that ruined him; he'd been in Azkaban for 12 years barely hanging onto hope and then he tasted freedom for the briefest time only to have it taken away by people who were supposed to care for him. Like, who wouldn't go a bit nuts and break out, *and* as a grown ass man, why'd he listen to anyone in the first place? If he'd gotten out of the house every once in a while, he'd probably have survived. 

I know Dumbledore was trying to protect him but, in the end, his actions (keeping Sirius pent up at home) lead to Sirius' mental breakdown and eventual death.",43,2020-05-15 01:20:48,-0.8045

For me the worst one was wizarding culture. Ron was crucial to Harry and Hermione understanding the wizarding world. Like when Malfoy calls Hermione a mudblood, she didn‚Äôt even know what that was until Ron explained, but in the movies she‚Äôs sobbing and knows immediately - that makes no sense! 

Also in the books Ron was so loyal! He stands up for Hermione and Harry again and again not caring he‚Äôll get in trouble.

Even if Hermione is very intelligent and resourceful, she is quite book smart, meaning she doesn't know a lot about the finer, day-to-day workings of the Wizarding World. Neither does Harry. But Ron does, and that helps them countless times. 

I hated how they changed that scene in CoS where they explained what a mudblood is. Ron would know what that means, but since it's slang, anyone who wasn't well acquainted with the WW wouldn't. I would love to know what book movie-Hermione read that in.

But, it's not until he asks her out, and the months following the Yule Ball, where they really get to know each other. Maybe there's something I'm forgetting, though.

I guess that's a long-winded way of saying I think Krum definitely found Hermione attractive long before he really knew just how intelligent she was, so it seems like this places Krum on a bit of a moral pedestal that I'm not sure he really earned.",738,2018-10-08 17:17:18,0.9366

It's superficial and absolutely has to do with her appearance, smile, laugh - things you pick up on from a distance.  Hermione is flattered by his affection and when they go to the ball and begin talking, he is kind and enthusiastic to talk to her.  This is probably the first time Hermione has ever felt this desired, and she likes the attention and likes Krum.  However, she clearly never falls for him like he does for her.  There's no passion on her side.  It's unclear if they ever kiss.  He invites her to spend a summer with him and she declines.  She writes him letters but that sounds like her acting as a friend rather than a true love on her side.  Power couple would be an overstatement, as Krum really isn't that impressive as a character.  He's brave, loyal, athletic.  He isn't necessarily that bright or funny, and he's definitely nothing like Ron (aside from his insecurity and jealousy).  Yes he fell for Hermione when no one at Hogwarts was giving her any attention, but thats no reason to say they're perfect for each other.  Hermione obviously didn't think so.",15,2018-10-08 22:33:12,0.9902

Just my humble opinion,,2021-02-02 02:47:19,21171,183,0.0,"I like that Neville, as the almost Chosen One, played a huge part in bringing down Voldemort by killing Nagini. His whole tenure at Hogwarts he felt unworthy, especially of being a Gryffindor, and there he was pulling out Gryffindor's sword at the end, and standing up for himself and others. Only a true Gryffindor could pull it out of the hat. It was his moment of vindication of his place in the magical world. That was his moment. He became a true Gryffindor, something he'd been trying to live up to. And, being natural enemies (Grffindor and Slytherin), to prove it against an actual snake. So, the way it played out is better than him killing Bellatrix, in my opinion. I don't think it was ever about revenge for him, but standing up against the sort of people who would torture his family to insanity. Besides, we are made to focus on Bellatrix, but she wasn't the only one present. 

Molly, throughout the series, is shown to be this motherly, doting person. But as the years go by, we are shown a more ruthless side by the way she insists upon protecting Harry, and her family. Her killing Bellatrix shows us how powerful she truly is, and how far she would go to protect her own. She'd face up to the unhinged woman who seems to have opposing values. It's ultimately a love vs hate battle there, what the whole book is about. They go toe-to-toe, and love wins out. 

So, I like the way it went for these characters.",66,2021-02-02 05:07:23,0.8367

Would you believe Harry?,,2024-10-08 05:51:18,20851,97,0.0,"While I understand this is a meme post I still think I should mention a couple of things. 

1. Harry never said that there are no other people who witnessed it. He specifically mentioned all the death eaters that came to Voldemort. 
2. He never said that he would not take the truth serum. 
3. He never said that they should not investigate.
4. He never wanted the gold price money. 

Additionally, they literally had a death eater in custody before fudge let the dementors kiss him. 

Also in what world do you believe that a teenager would just kill a fellow student for a couple of coins, especially if he himself already has quite a lot of money? 

So while I would maybe have my reservation about who exactly killed Cedric, or if Voldemort is actually back, I would not believe that Harry is to blame. 
Additionally I would want an investigation, even if only to find out if 1-2 death eaters did it for fun or what the fuck is going on.

While I am no defender of Snape and I certainly don't think he was a ""good"" person at any point in his life, in this particular case his actions made sense. He could tell James was dead, so there was no point in stopping for him. His primary concern was Lily, so he moved on to find her. Upon finding her dead his grief overtook him so he held her body and lost it. Harry was of course traumatized and crying, but physically unharmed for the most part and not in any present danger, so why would he bother with him when the woman he loved and was there to save was lying on the floor lifeless? It wasn't a ""demonstration of love"" it was a meltdown in grief. There was nothing he could do for any of them at that point, so I'm not sure what else anyone would have expected of him. Yes, he could've held Harry instead of his dead mother and tried to comfort him, but that's the only remotely useful thing he could've done and it's so far out of character for Snape that it's an absolutely absurd mental image to even attempt to picture.",13,2019-12-29 23:13:57,-0.8662

"Could have, you know, helped Harry",,2019-12-29 13:50:58,20656,62,0.0,"Snape‚Äòs not a perfect person by all means. But of course, if you see the love of your life dead on the floor because of your fault, I think it‚Äòs entirely realistic  to care about that first and formost. More than about her husband who bullied you and who you hated and he hated you (especially when you are in a hurry to get upstairs to see whether your love is still alive). And as to Harry, Snape is obviously not a huge lover of children. And even if Harry cried, he was one year old and wouldn‚Äôt be traumatised for the rest of his life, he wouldn‚Äôt even remember. Snape‚Äòs intervention here wasn‚Äôt necessarily for Harry to get away with little longlasting emotional impact.
Keeping this in mind, I totally understand his priorities.
Also, it was mostly meant to be a cinematic and visually sad moment, it wouldn‚Äôt have had an impact on audiences had he just kept calm, payed his respect to James, closed his eyes and maybe burry him, to then slowly go upwards, be a bit sad over Lily‚Äòs death but mostly care about Harry. This just wouldn‚Äôt have been very interesting or shocking, visually.
As to his behaviour to Lily being described as creepy by some here,I don‚Äôt think this means he never loved her really. Love isn‚Äôt always perfectly pure, we are flawed beings and therefore don‚Äòt always love the Romeo-and-Juliet sort of style. People can be sellfish while still deeply loving someone, or don‚Äôt trust you but still love youvat the same time- all bad characteristics don‚Äòt just disappear when we‚Äòre in love. We tend to believe that because most romance movies totally spoil us, but people still retain their flaws, even when in love.
Snape was always far from perfect, so his love isn‚Äòt perfect either. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it was never love in the first place.
There‚Äòs not just 2 options between absolutely perfect, pure, flawless love for all of eternity, and no love at all.

> There is clear evidence that the Chamber was opened more than once between the death of Slytherin and the entrance of Tom Riddle in the twentieth century. **When first created, the Chamber was accessed through a concealed trapdoor and a series of magical tunnels. However, when Hogwarts‚Äô plumbing became more elaborate in the eighteenth century** (this was a rare instance of wizards copying Muggles, because hitherto they simply relieved themselves wherever they stood, and vanished the evidence), the entrance to the Chamber was threatened, being located on the site of a proposed bathroom. The presence in school at the time of a student called Corvinus Gaunt ‚Äì direct descendant of Slytherin, and antecedent of Tom Riddle ‚Äì explains how the simple trapdoor was secretly protected, so that those who knew how could still access the entrance to the Chamber even after newfangled plumbing had been placed on top of it.",383,2021-02-17 10:37:31,0.5647

I believe there is some favouritism within her own family however it is not linked to whoever she loves most, it seems strongly linked to whoever lives up to her high expectations like being head boy, prefect, quidditch captain, successful career etc. Whoever meets her approval seems to get a wave of additional affection and approval from the Weasley matriarch.",262,2021-06-05 10:56:40,0.9927

Even when I was younger, sometimes my parents pretended to be forgetful about something to indulge our young minds.

For example, when I was younger and when we would go to a mall with a parking garage or an amusement park with sections numbered off like A2, B4, etcetera, my parents would ask me and my younger siblings to remember the section where they parked the car. After finishing whatever we were doing that day, my dad would ask us, ‚ÄúHmm, I forgot where we park the car.‚Äù We would ended up shouting the section number and dragging our parents to the car like a pack of dogs that zoned in on a scent. 

I‚Äôm 18 now and know for certain that my dad has really good memory about almost everything. I know that he was indulging us as children. So whenever I see people on the internet say Molly had some sort of nefarious reason to call out the platform number, I wanted to bang my head to the wall. It‚Äôs a children book.

To me the interesting game to play is: ‚Äúhow random/arbitrary is this action in each book?

PS/SS: Moderately arbitrary. It just so happened to take Voldemort and Quirrell the length of one school year to figure out the enchantments and lure Dumbledore away. 

COS: At first blush seems pretty arbitrary but I‚Äôve got some good head canon here: Riddle had been trying throughout the year to get Harry interested enough in the diary to let the diary possess him.  But with the school year drawing to a close and Ginny stealing back the diary Riddle basically sighed and said ‚Äú....fuck this, playing my trump card‚Äù and lured Harry to the chamber instead. He probably didn‚Äôt want to wait all summer and risk someone discovering what was going on with Ginny, so the end of the year forced his hand. 

POA: Not Voldemort, but arbitrary as fuck. Total happenstance that Sirius managed to get his hands on Scabbers at the end of the year. The whole story changes if he had found the rat during his forays into the school.

GOF: not at all arbitrary and this bothers people as a weak plot point. Voldemort had deliberately planned it all to happen on a very specific day, and lots of readers basically say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs stupid, he should have made it more random/arbitrary. Why not just have moody lure Harry into the woods and portkey him from there?  The woods is supposed to be dangerous, would anyone really question the death more than a death during the triwizard tournament?‚Äù

OOTP: Pretty egregious example here. You could argue it‚Äôs sort of like COS where Voldemort was trying to get it done ASAP and didn‚Äôt want to deal with summer break, but that‚Äôs shaky. And Voldemort got the information about Sirius being the lure as early as Christmas. Did it really take 5-6 months to come up with the plan to injure buckbeak and send the vision?  Lol maybe we could headcanon that Voldemort couldn‚Äôt get unfettered access to Harry‚Äôs brain enough to send the vision until he was truly exhausted by exams and staying up the night Hagrid got attacked. That‚Äôs the only way to un-arbitrary this, and it‚Äôs shaky as hell. 

HBP: not Voldemort, and this is another very arbitrary one. We‚Äôre never told exactly what sorts of things draco was attempting to fix the cabinet, so we‚Äôre just left with pure coincidence that it takes him exactly one school year to do it.

As a die hard fan of the books since Philosopher's Stone was published in '97, Dan never quite sat right with me in the role. He was wooden as fuck; the acting in those films - especially the earlier ones and especially from the trio - not exactly stellar. Dan was wooden and Emma repeatedly went OTT as though she were in a pantomime; Rupert was the only natural performer but the films repeatedly treated Ron as little more than comic relief which was an insult to actor and character. 

But post films, Dan's done some sterling films more befitting to a his talents, and comes across really well in interviews and the like as well. He's got a good sense of humour and appears humble and genuine. For reasons I can't explain, *What If* is my true guilty pleasure movie; I've watched it about 10 times and it never gets old.

The average Hogwarts student didn't really have to face risks that the school nurse wouldn't be able to fix. If you life in a world where mending a broken bone takes just one spell, you can afford to take greater risks. 

The exception being of course the '92 school year with the chamber opening.

But really, the whole Wizarding World seems like such a dangerous place to live, FOR MUGGLES. We have to keep in mind that they can heal pretty much ANYTHING that doesn't straight up kill you. Remember that getting torn apart by apparating the wrong way is presented as a JOKE to Harry for years until he sees it with his own eyes.

I guess the obvious choice was a snake but I don't' believe he would have been any kind of slithery creature, he's too posh to crawl around.

His contribution to the group would have been to brew the potions that kept Lupin lucid, and he would have excelled at becoming an animagus. He could have flown and scouted ahead for wandering students or villagers, he would never have wanted to get his hand's dirty rustling and tussling with the others. Being a winged creature / not having 4 legs would have made him somewhat less bonded to the others and would have fit with his outcast nature. He could have later spied on Lily and James hanging about the grounds, causing a natural break in the group as both friends were in love with her.

I crafted-up and surprised her with the letter at our favorite restaurant the night before we were set to go and she definitely did not see it coming, those tears are real! She is the most amazing best friend anyone could ever ask for and has done so much for me, being able to give her this made me the happiest person in the world! The trip was so perfect and amazing that it still feels like a dream. My favorite part if I had to choose one - all three days we dressed in our respective matching house gear (of course) and people all over the place pointed out how strange it was to see a Ravenclaw (me) and Slytherin (her) getting along so we found ourselves constantly boasting about our amazing friendship. Being surrounded by fellow HP-nerds is a sense of euphoria that can‚Äôt even be explained, we‚Äôve wanted to go back since the moment we left. 

EDIT: forgot to say she already got me back good by throwing me [a HP themed bachelorette party ](https://imgur.com/a/e3LHw) shortly after this.

Edit: If there are any fellow designers who'd like to make their own covers, here is the blank template that I created in InDesign. It will fit Books 1 and 2. To make it fit the other books, simply adjust the width of the spine to match the width of the book. I haven't done it yet, since I don't have physical hardcover copies of the other ones yet.

you must be a weasley,,2020-01-11 18:07:32,18998,33,0.0,"Holy shit. I just realised something.

The first time that Harry meets the Weasleys was at the station in front of the entrance to platform 9 3/4. Exactly where Harry would get lost.

It is ensured that the first wizard his own age that Harry meets (unaccompanied) is Ron, which means that for a boy who has been isolated and abused his whole life, he's going to form a strong friendship with the first peer that shows him kindness (no sources, personal experience).

Harry forms a strong and lasting bond with Ron almost immediately.

When shit goes down at the Dursley's, it's always the Weasleys who pick up the slack.

Molly and Arthur Weasley never show any sort of criticism or negative emotion towards Harry, even when he steps out of line - even when they chastise their own children.

**Molly and Arthur are both members of The Order of the Phoenix.**

One might surmise from this that Molly and Arthur were deliberately planted by Dumbledore to be an immediate set of kind, loving parents for Harry, to ensure that he feels at home in the Wizarding World. Molly and Arthur are all but foster magical parents for Harry. Hell, it might have been James and Lily who set this all up, not Dumbledore. Maybe all the members of the OoTP with children had this sort of agreement - like magical godparents.

EDIT: Let me add that this isn't meant to be framed as a bad thing. It's a fantastic thing. It gave Harry a true home (outside of Hogwarts), a place where he could feel safe and loved. That the Weasleys took him in with such grace and love is amazing.",225,2020-01-11 20:07:31,0.9827

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.",611,2023-03-20 11:34:37,0.99

Severus did everything Regulus did and then some, for longer, lost much more, and unlike Regulus who ultimately only created problems, he was actually helpful.

B. Slughorn is a coward who needed to be convinced that it was in his own best interest to return to Hogwarts. He needed to be shitfaced to own up to his mistake. Yeah, it's brave to take responsibility for screw-ups... here's Severus taking responsibility for his actions:

>‚ÄúThe ‚Äî the prophecy . . . the prediction . . . Trelawney . . .‚Äù  
‚ÄúAh, yes,‚Äù said Dumbledore. ‚ÄúHow much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?‚Äù  
**‚ÄúEverything ‚Äî everything I heard!‚Äù said Snape. ‚ÄúThat is why ‚Äî it is for that reason ‚Äî he thinks it means Lily Evans!‚Äù** 

Also:

>‚ÄúIs this remorse, Severus?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI wish . . . I wish I were dead. . . .‚Äù

Also the very act of giving Harry his memories, willingly, with his last breathes, without Harry needing Felix Felicis to accomplish this.

C. The text doesn't say that Narcissa made eye contact with Voldemort, but in any case, if that impresses you, how is years of that? And specifically:

>‚ÄúSaturday . . . at nightfall,‚Äù repeated Voldemort. **His red eyes fastened upon Snape‚Äôs black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into Voldemort‚Äôs face** and, after a moment or two, Voldemort‚Äôs lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.

D. Andromeda *is* brave for suffering enormous loss and persevering. That is... exactly Severus's story? Only he persevered for a child who wasn't even related to him? And this required him to abandon his original goals, and suffer constant danger, and loneliness, and hatred, and torture.

If you need to reduce Severus's arc to ""friendzoned"" to stan your Slytherin faves, maybe they're just not that impressive, or maybe they're all impressive in their way and there's no need to lower one to elevate the others.",299,2020-09-17 19:25:19,-0.9365

Prior to Harry's return to Hogwarts in book seven, Neville had already created an active insurgency based in the Room of Requirement that regularly staged commando raids against the administration there. By then he was pretty much the Rambo of Hogwarts, so standing up to Voldemort and cutting the head off Nagini was completely in character for him when he did it.

Poor Hagrid    ,,2024-09-25 12:52:45,18277,96,-0.4767,"This gets posted at least once a week, kinda tiring. I think fanfiction and the movies made fans ignore the nuance of the series and disregard analysis.

Harry naming his kid Albus Severus is absolutely in line with his character and a perfect conclusion because:

1) By doing this he demonstrates the kind person he truly is, he holds no grudges and values aspects like sacrifice and courage.

2) He is honoring the memory of two men who would otherwise be incapable to leave their legacy as they didn‚Äôt have any family. We know that for wizards it is common for middle names to relate to their parents or members of the family. Albus and Severus would never be used by any one else if Harry didn‚Äôt name his kid that way, legacy and family is important for Harry so it makes sense he would like these names to be remembered 

3) By honoring Snape he is showing forgiveness and hoping that just like he was able to forgive Snape, the rest of the wizarding world will forgive him for all the deaths caused during the battle (I‚Äôm not saying that Harry is guilty but that knowing Harry, I‚Äôm sure he had to deal with guilt‚Ä¶ in the same way that he felt guilty about Cedric‚Äôs death)

In all seriousness, there have been a thousand explanations as to why people don't use the simple methods like Imperio or the Memory Bowl. Most of it has to do with ""The Truth is Different for Everyone"" or ""Memory altering charms exist"" and other ways that can mislead or deceive people.

Though why *no one* took even the suggestion Voldemort came back seriously demonstrates the blinding incompetence of the Ministry of Magic and their willingness to take the easy road instead of the hard road.

And before someone comes at me with ""But they didn't want to cause a mass panic"", it's better for everyone to be prepared than for Voldemort to walk down Diagon Alley like he owns the place",392,2021-08-12 21:02:15,0.7746

Redid the Malfoys to look more rich and groomed, but I kept Draco the way he was. Only Narcissa was described as attractive. Uhm, the Weasley freckles were toned down to look less acne-ish, McGonagall was given square glasses, Fleur's hair changed to silver, etc.

The point of Snape's reveal was never to erase everything bad he ever did.

(Idk why anyone would think that) He understood that the world ain't black and white.

I'm sure he saw the same escense in both Dumbledore and Snape. Both made mistakes, followed the wrong guy and accidentally caused the death of a loved one. It's just that Dumbledore chose to hide his bad side and Snape chose to hide his good side.

This is so true üòÇüò©,,2021-05-01 07:54:36,17790,41,0.6615,"To slightly defend Molly here:

She knew the environment Harry was raised in was an environment of indifference and downright hostility. She knew that the Dursleys never wanted to care for Harry and never loved him whatsoever, and she probably knew that he spent his childhood in a cupboard with nothing, watching his cousin being spoiled and pampered while he had nothing.

That's why she seems to be overdoting on him to the point of smothering him; she wanted to give him the parental love that Harry craved for and missed in his life. Most likely, she probably knew, or even met, James and Lily beforehand, because, while Molly and Arthur weren't in the original order, her two older brothers were, and most likely met the Potters via her brothers. 

That doesn't mean that she didn't care or love her children less, it means that she gave more affection to Harry because he had none of it during his childhood years. While this was to the detriment of Ron (who resented it and had fears from it as well), she never meant to actually spite Ron. She still loves her son, but she wanted Harry to know that, even if his mother was dead, she could be a mother to him as well, and tried her best to present it. 

This is also the crux of the argument between Sirius and Molly in OoTP. Sirius, who was a bit stir crazy, rebellious old self (and who was emotionally stunted after spending 12 years in Azkaban) was much more supportive of giving Order info about Harry (	since they could both relate to a feeling of isolation, Harry with the Dursleys during that summer, and Sirius being in Azkaban and then stuck in the house he hated so much). Molly was in momma bear mode and wanted to protect Harry and didn't want him involved, seeing him still as a kid, and one she cared for (kind of like Dumbledore). 

Also, thankfully, this is where Arthur, who sees his children more as independent adults, serves as her opposite and that's why he complements her parenting with his own.",195,2021-05-01 13:56:44,-0.7357

Did slytherins Comeback ?,,2019-12-26 03:23:14,17535,63,0.0,"My Theory on Slytherins was that they couldn't fight in the Battle, even if their direct family members weren't Death Eaters, some of their extended family would have been, like how Sirius was related to Bellatrix. Even then, their friends in Slytherin house would have had Family fighting with the Death Eaters, and then even more people still would have known people bewitched like Stan Shunpike who would have been fighting while imperiused.

How could you ever faced your best friend again knowing you were the one that Stunned his Mother and that's why she got stepped on by a Troll in the Battle of Hogwarts? How could you ever speak to your Cousin again after you set his Father's Hair on fire and that's how the Giant Squid ate him?

Slytherin house represents Family, it's one of the things they hold dear and value, which why they all got wrapped up in the 'Pure Blood' nonsense in the first place. Turning against each other like that would be impossible for a Slytherin, it would be betraying their very core beliefs that they've been building their personalities around since the beginning of Hogwarts.

However, even with all that in mind, I don't think they could abandon their friends and House members by walking away from the battle and leaving all their friends and family to fair for themselves. The same values that would keep them from fighting against each other would also keep them from walking away from it too.

So, the only logical answer is that they were there after the fighting was done. They healed the wounded, they gathered the dead, they grieved with the ones who remained, and nourished the ones that had fought until they had nothing left. Slytherin house was the one that took all the broken pieces and had to find a way to put them all back together again in the aftermath.  They might not have been able to fight in the battle, but they redeemed themselves by fighting to hold everyone together when it was over.",111,2019-12-26 06:38:51,-0.768

I mean sure, in the movies, you could replace Ginny with a washing machine and it wouldn't make a difference, but book Ginny is really developed as a character. Especially after the order of the Phoenix. Harry liking Ginny isn't strange or out of the ordinary. We know Ginny is quite popular in school, so she must be good looking, and is a very good wizard (she survived the battle of Hogwarts) She's also an excellent Quidditch player, which gives Harry all the more reason to like her. The reason why Harry discovers his love after half the series has ended is because that's the time when he's a teenager. Who expected a 10 year old Harry to go after girls? I thought JK Rowling built it up well too. We knew Harry and Ginny were gonna end up together, because of their chemistry since the the order of the Phoenix.

We also know that Ginny likes Harry too, mostly because of him being the chosen one, but also because he cares for other people's lives and does everything to save them. This does not make it creepy, as some other user pointed out in the thread. She says this just after Dumbledore's death too, so obviously she's emotional and saying the truth.

&#x200B;

24 hours or so: 

&#x200B;

Gringotts, 

&#x200B;

Riding a Dragon

&#x200B;

Meeting Alberforth and learning a bit more about Dumbledore

&#x200B;

Getting into the castle and meeting up with the friends and defenders

&#x200B;

Chasing Snape out

&#x200B;

Finding out about Ravenclaw and fight in the ROR 

&#x200B;

Finding out about Snape and seeing him die. (All while the battle is going on and his friends are dying)

&#x200B;

Watching all the memories of Snape, his Mum and Dad 

&#x200B;

Meeting Voldemort in the forest, dying and coming back to life after a chat with Dumbledore

&#x200B;

And then the end battle.

&#x200B;

\+ deciding to destroy the Wand.

&#x200B;

Wow... thats a 24 hours",711,2018-10-04 20:25:30,-0.0258

I mean honestly if you didn‚Äôt read the books, you wouldn‚Äôt believe that Harry and Ron were best friends. Harry is played so aggressively. When Ron is about to destroy the locket, in the movie, Harry says ‚ÄúWell why did you even come back üëπ‚Äù

Whereas in the book, Harry is so nice to Ron. He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got to be you that destroys it, I know it. You got this bestie ü•∫‚Äù

And also one of my favorite scenes is when he‚Äôs bringing Ron back to the tent and he tries to fade into the background thinking Hermione is going to be so happy. And the Hermione goes to attack Ron & he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúYikes was not expecting that‚Äù and goes to separate them. And even Hermione‚Äôs anger at Ron and her bad mood in the coming days can‚Äôt do anything because his mood is instantly lifted and his heart is so happy because his best friend is back. 

I loved Harry and Ron‚Äôs friendship in movies 1-2 but then all of a sudden starting in the film for PoA, Harry turns so aggressive & moody, especially towards Ron. Like I get that he‚Äôs a teen boy and can be moody but I just don‚Äôt see him as kind and nice character in the movies, he‚Äôs so snappy. And one of the most important things about him in the books (aside from book 5 where his PTSD is CRAZY) is his kind heart and how nice he is despite all that he‚Äôs gone through. Ron‚Äôs his best friend, he mentions all the time how he loves Hermione but life just isn‚Äôt as fun without Ron there (when they fight). I‚Äôm positive that in the books, he‚Äôs snapped more at Hermione than he has at Ron. But in the movies he‚Äôs always snapping at Ron. 

I don‚Äôt want a live-action show for many reasons but I just pray that they do my boy Ron justice. I love the main trio so much in the books but I love Ron the most. The most genuine and realistic character, he‚Äôs so loyal and would do anything for Harry even when his worst impulses come to light, it‚Äôs never for long. Yes he was a bit moody in Goblet of Fire but he was 14. People are allowed their weak moments.

""Lupin's face was pale. ""Let's - let's find the others. Where are they all, Neville?"" 

Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke. It sounded as if every word were causing him pain."" 

So here Lupin has just watched his last and best friend die, and he pulls himself together to find his students (whose actions caused the battle to be necessary) because despite his pain he knows they're probably injured and in danger.

He is infected with Lycanthropy due to his father's mean words towards werewolves, even though Dumbledore managed to secure his place at Hogwarts, he still had to live with a monthly cycle of painful transformation.

Then he met his first friends, and when they find out he's a werewolf, they turn into unregistered Animagi to make him company during his dangerous periods. Then, ten years later, he loses all of them, two dying for real, one faking his death and one being wrongly convicted.

Over ten years later, he is invited to teach at Hogwarts, but still hiding his condition, but all that crumbles when someone whom I shan't name (SEVERUS SNAAAAAAAAAPE!) shares his secret, and he is sacked from a good job.

One year later, he is falls in love with a fellow Order member, but due to his condition, tries to keep his distance only to learn she loves him back.

During the aforementioned battle he loses anpther of his friends, and one year after that he finally gives in to his feelings and marries the woman he loves only to learn that she is pregnant, which makes him leave her in self-disgust, only to later repent and return to her.

Then his child is born without his condition, but he barely has time to spend with him, because both he and his wife DIE IN A FUCKING BATTLE!

Remus had it rough,,2020-11-27 14:26:21,16947,106,0.0,"Remus Lupin is one of the bravest Griffindors to have ever lived, and it's dumbfounding that fandom so rarely recognizes him as such.

From the age of 4 he found himself in a world that vehemently rejected him. He got the rare possibility for education which other werewolves did not get, but he managed to achieve so much thanks to that luck. Studying in Hogwarts was astonishingly brave in itself. Being open about your werewolf identity to your friends at the age of 14 must've been terrifying.

In the wizarding wars, Remus was in a position where he could lose everything. Sure, he gained much from being part of the fighting force, but he made himself a target for the death-eaters and their supporters, and he could've made himself a target for the werewolves society within which he was a spy. He could've lost his place both in the wizarding world and in the werewolf community, which would leave him completely alone.

But regardless of all of that, he managed to do so much during the wars! Gathering important information for the order, participating in almost every important battle we saw in the last few books and having guest appearances on Potterwatch. Even teaching in Hogwarts between the wars must've been a truly scary experience. Being outed as a werewolf while being a professor could put him in real danger.

So why don't we remember him for his bravery as much as he deserves? In my opinion, and in my opinion only, it is because of his kindness. Remus was a kind sensitive man, and he didn't posses the rough masculinized bravery Sirius (my favorite character) and Moody had. And his kind of bravery is the kind we find harder to recognize as such. But Remus's emotionality made him a great teacher and a great mentor for Harry. It made him a good person. The only times we see his fears posses him is when he's afraid of hurting others, his wife and son. And Remus's kindness was a big part for him for fighting for what's right and getting over his fears. Remus Lupin was not a fearless man. But he didn't have to be, because he was a brave one.",27,2020-11-27 17:39:02,0.978

The other side is that just because the actors perform a script brilliantly doesn't mean that the script couldn't have been better. There are definitely big problems with the script that  disagree with the world created in the novels, that's just undeniable. It's also equally understandable why people dislike it.

Because you're comparing studying magic to studying boring muggle stuff, but the competition is between studying magic and having magic fun (gobstones, quidditch, etc etc). 

Not to mention I feel to Harry the even bigger deal is probably having friends for the first time in his life, so it makes sense that he wants to have fun with his friends.

Not to mention, there's plenty of kids out there that can't go to school because of various reasons and probably have the same sentiment about people complaining about their studies.

Oh, and Hermione I'm pretty sure was JUST as dedicated and thorough about her muggle studies before coming to Hogwarts. She's not studying because oooh magic, she's studying because hell yeah books and homework is the real stuff!",860,2019-02-26 19:47:32,0.9801
Harry could have shown more enthusiasm in learning magic,,2019-02-26 18:58:04,16779,115,0.4927,"Homework is homework. Once you get used to something, it becomes work.

I remember being super psyched to learn Japanese and Photography because I had an idealized perception of it. 

Then I learned that actual work is involved, and that takes the fun out of it. 

Transfiguration: Requires apparently a ton of complex calculations to understand things. I get shades of Equivalent Exchange alchemy from it; You can't just turn one thing into something totally different, at least not without figuring out how the two relate and accounting for disastrous results. 

Charms: Less calculative than Transfiguration, but you still have to be extremely precise, with tons of verbal and physical practice, unless you want to end up squished under a buffalo or levitate an object in the wrong direction and accidentally kill someone or yourself. 

Herbology:...Everything wants to kill you as well.

Care of Magical Creatures: Everything there wants to kill you.

Potions: Straight up chemistry but with arbitrary rules that you MUST learn by heart and reproduce exactly or instead of a wart remover you end up with a lethal poison. Have I mentioned these classes are kind of dangerous?

Broom lesson: See Neville's traumatic first encounter. 

Arithmancy: Yay, elective math! That's ironic. 

Astronomy: Were you planning to sleep that night? Nope. 

And everything comes backed with essays. Which you have to write by HAND, with ink that you're stuck with unless you've mastered an ink-vanishing spell. 

TLDR: Work is work. Magic takes a lot of work to learn, and the workload seems a bit frustratingly arbitrary given the potential disastrous results if you don't get the hang of these arbitrary rules.  But the bottomline is that once you get used to something, it's no longer that amazing.",141,2019-02-26 22:54:06,-0.9805

Professor Snape to Bellatrix:

‚ÄúI think you next wanted to know,‚Äù he pressed on, a little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, ‚Äúwhy I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone. That is easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledore‚Äôs stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have returned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.‚Äù",4940,2024-03-01 03:48:56,-0.8661

As he had no realistic reason to presume that Voldemort was alive, Voldemort accepted that Snape thought he was dead and did not begrudge his actions.

Voldemort: Ah Severus, you have finally returned, but not when I called. 

Snape: Yes my Lord, I was following Dumbledore's orders. 

V: Dumbledore's orders?

S: Yes my Lord, you asked me to spy on Dumbledore and thus I had provided you the information that made you go after Harry Potter. After your disappearance, in order to not be arrested and keep my job as a spy, I had to lie and say that I was misled and lost the woman I had loved, and also convince the ministry that I was a spy for them against you. 

V: And they believed it?

S: Yes, though it was Dumbledore who vouched for me, so convincing him was the hardest thing to do. 

V: Understandable, but you never sought me out, never made sure I was really dead. Very disappointed in you Severus. 

S: Quite right my Lord and forgive me for saying so, but the benefit was a comfortable job that kept me out of prison. It was also a better option as I was able to keep an ear out for news about you which my job as a teacher at the school and a member of the Order of the Phoenix provided plenty. Dumbledore knew I was a Death Eater and asked me to be that but also be a spy for him. So it enabled me to ensure I was meeting you with his knowledge, to assure him that he's sending me as his own spy into your ranks. 

V: And Harry Potter? You could've killed him all these years, yet you've never done so?

S: I agree my Lord, but the boy was too much loved and protected. Also, as mentioned earlier Dumbledore's protection was keeping me out of Azkaban, and I wouldn't be stupid enough to do anything that broke that trust. But it is a good thing I didn't kill him because right now your resurrection was possible because of his blood. 

V: Yet you didn't let me get the Philosopher's Stone when I was possessing Quirrell. I could've gotten back to full power then. 

S: Again my Lord, the protection I was enjoying was the only thing keeping me from Azkaban. I wasn't aware that you were possessing him until I found out after his death. And you had every right to distrust me because I might have turned against you, so revealing your presence to me might be doing more damage than good. 

V: Hmmm quite right, it is actually logical when you think about it. You have done well Severus. I now can rely on you to go back to Hogwarts as my spy. 

S: Thank you my Lord, but remember that I have to maintain the cover I had as Dumbledore's spy against you. He is no fool. 

V: Not to worry. Keep doing what you were doing right before I was resurrected. Assure Dumbledore you're working for him against me, but ensure I have information on the Order and the Ministry.",87,2024-03-01 12:44:19,0.9898

BUT

To play devil's advocate, from a movie-goer's perspective, I can understand why the change. They obviously wanted to portray that feel of a loving mother and father to a teenage boy. It WOULD look funny at first glance to see a 20 y/o father of an 11 y/o, just from a purely cinematic stance.

It is a bad choice for continuity and backstory, but I think a good one for optics.

He's just a dumpster fire of a person.",2022-01-06 21:29:48,16237,221,0.9494,"I think that the problem with Snape is that though he's clearly a grey character, the way he is described can be summarized as a huge canvas all painted in black, with a few white lines on the surface. His cruelty and bias as a teacher are nearly grotesque. And they are also very memorable because he is clever and witty. 

They also don't have a solid counterbalance up until the very end, because there are no humanizing touches. Looking through Harry's eyes, we are trapped in the ""Snape's rude - Snape's the big bad guy - Oh, alright, he wasn't the bad guy after all,"" until he turns out to be bad (though it's not convincing) only to reveal his true colors just before his death. He has no friends, no relationships in which he shows a different side.

If I were Rowling, I'd give him a few scenes in which he shows that his emotional range as an adult is a bit wider than what he demonstrates in front of Harry. Let him have a meaningful student-teacher relationship with Draco, give him a friend, whatever. But I'm not, so nevermind.

Still, I disagree that Snape has no redeeming qualities. He has a strong sense of duty, he's loyal to Dumbledore -- I know he has his reasons, but everyone has.

I also strongly believe that in the end, he did more good than bad. As readers, we are pushed to think more about what is described in more detail (like his bullying). We don't witness him having to endure pretending to be Voldemort's servant, even though Voldemort killed the one person he cared about. I don't think that with everything that happened to them, Hermione, Harry, or Neville were severely impacted by Snape's bullying. But their whole world was definitely impacted by his double-agent work.

Of course, all that I said is just for the fun of it, because it would be possible to like Snape even if he was all dark. Heroes, villains, or those in-between, they tend to be more likeable if they are interesting and witty (like Snape), compared to just annoying and boring (like Fudge or Lucius Malfoy, at least the way I see them).

Also don't think Sirius saw Harry as James, I think he was mostly frustrated and unable to cope with the situation which required him both to act as a parent and at the same time to do nothing and stay inside, which is why book 4 Sirius seems much more normal in comparison, even if he's eating rats

Curiously both Sirius, Lupin and Snape compare Harry to James, often with an intent to somehow manipulate him, considering Harry deep affection for his father and his sense of masculinity.",15,2024-10-14 18:36:21,-0.3818
Both Harry and Sirius saw each other as a substitute for James.,"I read this somewhere, and it has me rethinking their entire relationship now",2024-10-14 04:32:11,16234,52,0.0,"Lots of people disagreeing and while I will say it is a stretch for Harry to view Sirius as a substitute for James (I would say it's the first time he has ever had a likeable father figure though, so there are obviously elements of viewing him as the father he never had, if that's what OP is refering to) I will say that yes Sirius very much is using Harry as something of a substitute for his Best friend. I'm currently re-reading book 5 for the first time in years and I've really picked up on this theme.

Sirius was a young adult when James died and he was sent to Azkaban. 13 years later after going somewhat mad, he breaks out. 13 years of no growth, no external stimulus and the only thing that keeps him sane is knowing that he was innocent. He probably spent more time over those 13 years thinking about James than anything else. He gets out and finds the spitting image of his fixation of 13 years. The boy is also brave, a little reckless, not quite a big a bully as his dad but still. 

Of course Harry is a substitute for James to sirius. Sirius has the maturity of a teenager and has likely not been able to even process his best friend's death. Rereading the book (to my daughter now and she is loving them) and Sirius is a very different character from when I first read it as a teenager. But that's true for all the adult characters. I'm intrigued to see what I make of Dumbledore.

Damn good books, aren't they?",33,2024-10-14 06:57:07,0.9238

First, more people than just Harry can open the door. Ron was able to do so in Deathly Hallows and if I recall correctly he said specifically that he learned how to do it by listening to Harry open the locket horcrux. It's therefore canonically possible someone could breach the entrance and discover them.

Another issue is the stability of the tunnel. Lockhart caused a collapse with a memory charm from a faulty wand. Who knows what could happen with a couple dozen students learning powerful defensive magic.

Finally, the Room of Requirement was more amenable to giving Harry objects he needed for lesson planning. He wished for a bunch of cushions for one lesson and they immediately appeared. The Chamber of Secrets wouldn't have had that level of convenience.

Cho is still getting over Cedric. Harry was basically her rebound, and she thought they would trauma bond over Cedric. And Harry has never dated anyone by this point. Of course this wasn't going to work!

I'm not saying Cho can't hold feelings for Cedric, but she  was clearly struggling with her grief and put too much expectations on Harry. Grief is tricky to deal with, and dumping it on a guy your dating and expecting him to just take it in stride... that'd be a lot even without all the other stuff Harry was dealing with.

And in the movie?... Honestly a little better. He was a shoulder to cry on, but they seemed to get on all right. Plus, she was coerced to rat them out via truth serum, so that wasn't her fault.",14,2025-01-28 15:43:24,-0.949

He was terrified to visit his family...they‚Äôre giants. Full blood. Not very interested in Dumbledore‚Äôs army. The side with the more powerful is all they cared about, and Voldemort‚Äôs army was infiltrating the fucking government. Terrifying. 

But he went. He even got hurt if I remember correctly? Pretty bruised up by his family members who don‚Äôt see him as family. Super racist and classist shit. 

He tries to convince them that Dumbledore will win. That Harry Potter will win again. He believed in the cause so much. Convincing soldiers to be thinkers and questioners - not just followers-of-orders - is pretty intense.  He was always a bit of a fool in the movies. Loving, but a fool or comedic relief. In the books, he was a protestor. And he fought and killed during the battle of Hogwarts with the wizard/witch humans. Even though he didn‚Äôt fit in either place, he knew he was actually loved by humans - Harry included. Harry would give him honest love; what use is Voldemort‚Äôs power over that?

The cooler color schemes of the 3rd-onwards definitely took away from the warmth of Hogwarts, something the books didn‚Äôt really do until the end of book 6. 

In a way I understand the shift from warm to cool color tones after CoS, but the irony is it takes away from what makes Harry Potter so great. They lack that whimsical sense of childhood wonder a place like Hogwarts is supposed to give.

She was a new teacher at the time and I had changed school districts from one that had offered Latin in middle school to one that had not, so I came to High School with prior knowledge of the subject. It was also my \*passion\*. That having been said, she structured her vocabulary quizzes to give 1 extra bonus point per English derivative deriving from one of the words on the quiz. There was also extra credit coming from a vocabulary bingo/tictactoe like game she had had us all play. I scored a 208 on that quiz. That's how we found out you cannot input more than 125 for a single grade in the grade book program that district had opted to use. To get full credit, I was literally told to NOT do an assignment, receiving a 108 for the quiz and a 100 for the skipped assignment.

English isn‚Äôt my first language and I owe my good English to the Harry Potter books. When I was 10 and reading the Chamber of Secrets (I skipped Philosopher‚Äôs Stone since I saw the movie and my parents thought that buying me the book would therefore be a waste of money), I actually did think that ‚Äúbars‚Äù meant pubs, and I actually kept thinking that until I saw the movie. I actually believed that Vernon put pubs outside of Harry‚Äôs window to imprison him in his room. I remember thinking it was a little odd, but when I was little, I was not confident enough to believe in my own judgement regarding what does and does not make sense, so I believed that there was a good reason for Vernon to choose that method of imprisonment, but I was just too dumb to really understand what that reason was.  Please keep in mind that I was just a kid and had no idea that ‚Äúbars‚Äù meant anything other than pubs, at that point.

BUT if I was to put some spackle on this crack it would be this:

The Champions must give a *sincere* effort to compete: forfeiting, throwing the competition, or otherwise undermining the spirit of the competition by not doing your best would result in the contract being broken. 

This is a magical competition between schools and as such they want to truly see who is best, and the only way to do that is to effectively force the contestants to give it their all. This measure would be in place to prevent bribery or other forms of coercion to knock out competition. It‚Äôd be an anti-cheating spell in effect (we know those exist and therefore magic can parse out intent) 

So Harry is in, and Harry must compete and he must try his best or the contract is broken and something very bad happens. 

This could have been easily explained by having McGonagall (or other concerned party) say that she will have Potter forfeit at the start of each competition, that he doesn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúreally compete‚Äù. Have Moody/Crouch Jr. speak up saying the goblet wouldn‚Äôt like that and it‚Äôd rebound to Potters detriment. Like it or not he‚Äôs in, and he‚Äôs got to compete and he‚Äôs got to try and win.

He tried to be smart about it but it didn‚Äôt quite work out:

‚ÄúThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o‚Äôclock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn‚Äôt wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door ‚ÄúAAAAARRRGH!‚Äù Harry leapt into the air; he‚Äôd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat - something alive ! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle‚Äôs face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn‚Äôt do exactly what he‚Äôd been trying to do.‚Äù Harry Potter and the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone, pages 38-39

Also;
‚ÄúOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. ‚ÄúNo post on Sundays,‚Äù he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, ‚Äúno damn letters today ‚Äù Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one ‚ÄúOut! OUT!‚Äù Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.‚Äù

‚ÄúPelting like bullets‚Äù would certainly make them hard to catch, and they wouldn‚Äôt fall at his feet if he had to leap to catch one.

I'm fairly positive that school *everywhere* starts during or after summer. As in, for most of the world's population, that's August-September. 

But August-September isn't the (end of) summer everywhere, of course. In fact, everywhere south of the equator, summer is in December-January-February. 

Therefore, I believe the first person in the conversation is from the Southern Hemisphere -- Australia, NZ, southern half of Africa, most of Latin America, you get the idea. Their school year starts in January because that's the (end of) summer period for them. But that person seems to know very little of the world and assumes starting in January is the ""standard"", while neither January nor September is, and then assumes it's strictly an American (presumably US?) thing. 

And it gets worse: some American who also appears to know very little of the world chimes in with completely undeserved US=bad rhetoric* and even comes up with a bogus reason for it. 

And the the realisation: oh but *Hogwarts* starts in September! Well duh! Northern Hemisphere and all that!

I'll never understand how Voldemort managed to be considered the most dangerous dark wizard ever,,2022-12-10 18:12:09,15338,143,-0.5256,"Because we never saw voldemort in his prime. The voldemort we see in the HP era is a shadow of his former self. He is both physically and mentally broken, more reckless and arrogant than he has ever been and is essentially fighting an uphill battle due to restarting a war he lost badly 11 years ago. The fact that he accomplished so much with so little to work with is terrifying, but thats a debate for another day.

The point is, the voldemort that is the most dangerous dark wizard ever, isnt the broken shell of a man we have seen in HP books. Its the one before his downfall at the hands of baby harry. Its the one that created two horcruxes before he was 17. Its the one that literally cursed a job. Its the one who had powers not even dumbledore could obtain without abandoning his morals. Its the one that pushed the boundaries of magic further than they had ever been pushed. Its the one that effortlessly manipulated and played with everyone he met except for dumbledore. Its the one that started a war against britain, in front of and AGAINST prime dumbledore and was winning up until his trip to potters (grindelwald, in contrast, was so afraid of dumbledore he conquered everywhere BUT britain and got beaten/locked away the second albus said enough is enough). Its the one that terrorized the wizarding world so much people literally cant say his name without shaking in fear. THAT voldemort was the most dangerous dark wizard in history.

Also, I know its just a meme, but Im really tired of people unironically saying voldemort couldnt take over a high school or failed to kill a 17 year old in order to lowball him.

Also, while I‚Äôm by no means a Voldemort apologist (is that even a thing?) ‚Äî my guy had *Albus Dumbledore's* respect. The movies screwed him over & did not capture at all just how terrifying & hopeless Harry‚Äôs mission was; and consequently, how great his victory over LV was

Among other things, Voldemort managed to invent methods of unsupported flight (unlike the movies claim, he was the only one who had a funky flying cloud) while millions of wizards throughout the centuries had failed. He created seven Horcruxes which, while vile, was a great magical feat. He was the only known Dark Wizard to possess an army of Inferi (do undead, animated corpses defeated only by fire sound chill and passive?). He was capable of ‚Äúeffortless wandless & nonverbal‚Äù magic, a skill only the most powerful wizards had. He created a prosthetic, working silver arm for Pettigrew in a flick of a wand that also had charms imbued to choke him to death if he thought of betraying LV.

Dumbledore himself acknowledged that Voldemort's knowledge of magic was more extensive than any wizard to have ever lived (with presumably only Dumbledore standing as his equal in terms of magical knowledge) + he admitted that even his most powerful protective spells and charms could not effectively fight off Voldemort if the Dark Lord was ever at his full power

I hate to say this, because Harry is my very favourite character, but if not for the plot, Voldemort would have wiped the floor with them lol

I think fans sleep on this movie because of some of the low points like Harry being moody or Hagrid's brother sideplot, but I would argue that this movie has more High points than any other movie in the series. There are some genuinely intense scenes including the opening Dementor attack, the attack on Mr. Weasly, umbridge watching Harry carve his name into his own hand, and the entire 3rd act in the Ministry of magic. Also, the new characters introduced in this movie are some of the best in the series (Luna, Bellatrix, Umbridge) and it gives a ton of development to Neville instead of keeping him as the bumbling wimp. I believe it has the best original score since the first movie (my favorite songs include Fireworks, Dumbldore's Army, and The Ministry of Magic). It has the best wizard duel in any movie ever between Dumbledore and Voldy. And it shows Harry really step up to try and become a stronger wizard (Training oclumency, leading and training the DA, and fighting death eaters alongside the Order at the end).",93,2021-07-16 18:02:45,0.8968

Like, if it was spelled correctly, it could be perceived as a manipulative attempt to take Harry from his family.

In GOF he wanted to ask out the prettiest girl. But in OOTP he told Harry to date someone more cheerful. He learned to value personality. 

He was brought up with beliefs like werewolves and half giants were malicious. But he respected both remus and Hagrid. He defended Hagrid against Luna in OOTP when she insulted him. He defended remus in DH. 

He made fun of SPEW. but He was the one who remembered to save the house elves during the battle of Hogwarts when everyone had forgotten about them. 

He called Luna 'loony' in HBP. but he was the one who complimented her on her quidditch commentary when everyone thought it was ridiculous. He called her amazing thrice in DH. He learned to value her as a friend.

He was a prat at the yule ball. But he asked Hermione to dance with him at bill and Fleur's wedding. And not as a last resort. 

He made mistakes. He got jealous of Harry. But he ALWAYS came back and apologised. Owned up to his mistakes. 

He was rude to Hermione. He lacked tact. Instead of blaming it on others he read a whole ass book to improve himself. 

He called her a nightmare in 1st year. At the epilogue he was proud that his daughter had inherited her mother's brains. 

He fought his insecurities and won. He went from 'I am the 6th son in our family. I am in my brothers' shadow' to 'it's me. I am extremely famous'. 

Ron is one of the most well written, well structured characters in the whole series. He is my fav character. ‚ù§",37,2021-08-01 18:49:28,0.9886

Ravenclaws for the win!,,2018-03-27 06:48:03,15016,45,0.6239,"Harry wasn't chosen for Ravenclaw because he said ""Not Slytherin"".  

Let me explain:

A Slytherin is Ambitious.  A Slytherin is Cunning.  At the core, a Slytherin will choose the option that will most benefit them.  Variance aside, it's cold logic.  A Slytherin will tolerate an uncomfortable environment if it will prove beneficial.

At the point in the novels in which Harry is sorted, he knows exactly 2 things about Slytherin:

1. Hagrid told him that Voldemort was in Slytherin, and that that's where most bad wizards are from.

2. Draco Malfoy, a boy he found distasteful, was a Slytherin through and through.  

If Harry were a Slytherin, he would have taken those bits of information and digested them differently than he did.  If he were a Slytherin he would have said to himself ""I know my own morality, I will not lose myself, and if Slytherin is the house where I can become the best version of me possible then I can tolerate a distasteful house-mate.  I can stomach being in the same house as my parents' killer.""

If Harry were a Slytherin at the core, he would have tolerated uncomfortable circumstances to get ahead.  

Also note that the book gave him 3 options: Slytherin, Gryffindor, and Ravenclaw (sorry Hufflepuff).  The Hat says of Harry *""Difficult.  Very difficult.  Plenty of courage, I see.  Not a bad mind, either.  There‚Äôs talent, oh my goodness, yes‚Äîand a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that‚Äôs interesting‚Ä¶  So where shall I put you?""*

The hat is listing the three Houses Harry fits.  He has the intelligence and wits for Ravenclaw, the thirst to prove himself (ambition) for Slytherin, and the Courage of a Gryffindor.  He only makes one choice ""Not Slytherin"".  The hat sorts him into Gryffindor.

Harry's choice of telling the Hat ""Not Slytherin"" was not just him choosing houses, it was a demonstration of his true persona: he was not someone whose ambition ruled his choices.  

Harry's choice, interestingly enough, also ruled him out of Ravenclaw.  He made his choice of ""Not Slytherin"" based on emotion and limited information.  A Ravenclaw is Clever.  A Ravenclaw is Witty.  A Ravenclaw is for those who make the rational choice after considering all of the options using logic.

By saying ""Not Slytherin"" Harry is ruling himself out of Ravenclaw as well.  Not because he lacks the intelligence for Ravenclaw, but because he chooses to utilize his gut instinct over his logic and reason.  Harry did not weigh his options.  Harry put no logic or wit into his decision making.  He knew he would find being in Slytherin uncomfortable and made the call on gut instinct.

If the Sorting Hat had said ""So where shall I put you"" and Harry's response was to think ""Well, I want to be successful and Slytherin would be a big help there no doubt as that's what their main focus is... but Ravenclaw is where the intelligent go, and knowledge is power... but Gryffindor is for the Bold and I want to blaze my own path..."" then he'd have been a Ravenclaw.  A Ravenclaw would want to weigh their options and make the logical decision.

Harry's mind does not work that way.  

By saying ""Not Slytherin"" Harry demonstrated that he didn't have the traits of a Slytherin and that he didn't have the traits of a Ravenclaw.  Of the 3 options the Hat felt he fit, Gryffindor was the only house left.  The House where the Bold go.  The house for those who are willing to make gut decisions on limited information because it's what feels right.  By saying ""Not Slytherin"" Harry proved he hadn't the traits for any other house but Gryffindor.

If you dont put much (or any) thought into it, it does seem odd that Fred and George never comment on Ron hanging out with, and sleeping with Peter Pettigrew. Once you give it a minute of thought it makes perfect sense. The twins didn't want to spend a lot of time with their kid brother, so why would they risk getting caught with this wickedly awesome magical item just to watch a dot that represented him? They had to know that if a professor or prefect saw the marauders map it would be confiscated. Hell, another student learning about the map would be problematic. Presumably Fred and George used the map the same way Harry did. Get somewhere safe, open the map, make sure your path is clear, and wipe the map as soon as you're done with it. The only time Harry spent any time watching anyone's dot was in DH when he watched Ginny's. He did so when he was a safe distance from Hogwarts. Even when he was crushing on Cho Harry never put the map at risk by watching her on the map.",31,2019-09-15 14:45:13,0.3298

Arthur's surprisingly large influence in the Ministry low-key symbolizes the theme of the series.,"At first glance, Arthur appears to be a pretty meaningless cog in the Ministry machine.

His job doesn't pay him that well, and the department he heads, officially, isn't very powerful. Quite the contrary, his job is seen as kind of a joke. Nobody really cares about his department, it's mentioned that it's literally just him and one other guy.

And yet, despite that, Arthur seems surprisingly well-connected. He's able to score the best possible seats money can buy to the Quidditch World Cup, he's able to push through his Muggle Protection Act despite being deeply unpopular with the rich and powerful, and several times mentions ""pulling strings"" or calling in favors within the Ministry throughout the series.

And again, his department is seen as a joke, so it's not like he's well connected because his position is powerful, it's the opposite, his position only has what little power it does because Arthur is well-connected.

And the actual reason as far as I can tell why he has so much pull is that ***people simply like him.*** They help him out because he's *nice.* Ludo Bagman gets him those perfects seats because Arthur had helped him previously, and all the Ministry employees (even Crouch) seem genuinely friendly with Arthur because he's earnestly, enthusiastically pleasant to every single person he meets. Arthur Weasley is revealed to be a much richer man than he first appears, but his wealth is in reputation in stead of gold.

And that's kind of the main theme of the entire series, isn't it? That true power is one's ability to connect with other people, to be *kind* to people, and being the kind of person that people want to help. It's a less extreme version of exactly what enables Harry to be the hero and win in the end.",2020-08-14 11:26:38,14863,135,0.9929,"Additionally, look at the Weasley children:

* Curse breaker married to a beautiful and talented witch. Was Head Boy at Hogwarts.
* Dragon tamer and legendary Seeker.
* Ministry official at a very young age. Was Head Boy at Hogwarts.
* Wildly successful business owners at a young age with keen magical abilities to create their products. Also great Quidditch players.
* Auror who was instrumental in the defeat of Voldemort, married to the Minister of Magic. 
* Professional Quidditch player and extremely skilled witch who marries an Auror.


Like the Weasleys should be writing books on how to raise successful children. They clearly are extremely smart and also quite athletic and all extremely brave considering every single one of them showed up for The Battle of Hogwarts, and one of them died. Arthur‚Äôs connections through his children alone would outpace any other Wizard of his day.

Ron was made out to be some kind of dummy, yet he got OWLs in every subject except History of Magic and Divination, was one of only 12 students in his year to take NEWT potions, and was some sort of chess prodigy as well. And the least academically gifted of his children are able to create patented daydreams, love potions, and shield clothing that are so advanced they essentially become defense contractors for the Ministry of Magic.

Oh and let‚Äôs not forget that Arthur‚Äôs wife personally defeated Voldemort‚Äôs second in command in a duel. Just another day for the Weasleys.",2949,2020-08-14 14:13:45,0.9821

A dementor removes 10% of Harry‚Äôs total soul count.

**Exhibit A**: As much as Harry is innocent from his father's sins, Snape is unable to divorce his hatred towards James from Harry due to the sheer fact that they look alike.

**Exhibit B:** He is unable to let go of his attachment to Lily so much so that he would protect Harry just because he has Lily's eyes.

Everything he does is first and foremost in service to emotions which he chooses not to let go. It may seem ""romantic"" a decade ago but today, especially in light of the #MeToo movement, it just feels like dysfunctional attachment and entitlement over Lily.

It would make much more sense for it to be a snake in the context of the books than a lightning bolt, but she can't give that away in chapter 1 of the first book. It also explains why they drew the scar on Harry's head the way they did in the movies. Lightning bolts don't have little triangular tips on the end, but a crude snake sure would.

If I might make a suggestion: Make a custom Bertie Botts Box between now and Halloween and fill it with a variety of Jelly Belly Jellybeans since they make 50 different flavors.  Buy a variety pack, and then maybe a couple boxes of the Harry Potter ones since they have gross flavors included.  That way it's a more ""true"" mix of flavors, mostly good with the occasional gross one.  

Making the box shouldn't be difficult.  Get an empty Chinese food box, print off the decorations and glue.  Measure and cut the ""windows"" and then glue some clear plastic on the inside to cover the hole.

Why do people walk or donate to certain disease based charities? They've been affected by that disease either through their personal experience or someone dear to them.

I don't believe he did all he did because of Lily but that she was the catalyst that incited change in him.",19,2018-10-14 23:47:06,0.8765
This pretty much sums up my unpopular opinion,,2018-10-14 16:58:53,14343,60,0.4939,"I think a lot of the sympathy Snape gets has little to do with how he comported himself as a young adult/adult, but more to do with people recognizing how little of a chance he actually got to be good.

If you trace it up to the day he regrets most in his entire life: He was born incredibly poor and marginalized by English standards. It's not clear what exactly went on in his home life, but I *think* there's a case to be made for implied abuse, if not obvious neglect. This is not a recipe for success. Unlike Lily, it's also made clear that he's fairly ugly -- and as much as we don't like to admit it, the Halo Effect is a well documented psychological phenomena in humans. 

Then we get to Hogwarts and there's a bit of a chicken and egg. He's sorted into Slytherin -- is it because he's a bad person at heart, or does going to Slytherin snuff out any chance that he really has to be a good person? Ambition alone, and cunning? Those aren't out of place traits for a smart, underprivledged fella to have. He's *hungry*, to quote an overquoted modern musical.

But the house is infested with magicNazis and magicNazi propaganda. There's literally no way for a poor, unconnected literal child to survive in that kind of environment without at bare minimum acting the part. Seeing as Snape probably doesn't have a very rosy view of 'muggles' (here, the shitty people he was raised with/around, rather than all non-magics; a distinction hat I'm not sure we could fairly expect a child to draw), so he's already *ripe* for this exact kind of propaganda. Combined with the straight up rejection that he, and to some extent Slytherins in general, experience from the greater Hogwarts population? Well, it's basically a cult leader's wet dream. 

So, really, I think the most interesting thing about Snape as a bad person is that it's pretty hard to say that he ever really had a chance to be good. This becomes a lot more glaring when you contrast him with James Potter, whose bravery is totally admirable, but also has the distinctly unimpressive reality of being born from * a huge amount* of privilege. James is rich and popular -- and while it's certainly admirable that he uses those things for good, I don't think it would be fair to say anyone could be suprised by it. We're given indications that he's got a fairly stable home life, a familywho supports him (unlike Sirius' much more impressive act of familial abandonment), and he's sorted into a house that basically obligates him to be at least nominally heroic. He's... the rich kid who choose not be an asshole. It's good, yeah, but there's not a lot of weight there. 

So when Snape calls Lily a mudblood, there's a lot of dramatic weight to it. We, the audience, know it's coming, both because it's obvious from the future information we have and because we know it's inevitable based on the information we've been given about him up to this point. We know; and we understand. I certainly can't say I'd do any better it his position. A poor, friendless, utterly embarrassed nerd -- bullied and bitter in front of my crush who seems to be living a life that I'd almost kill for? I can feel for him -- I can feel for every teenage shithead careening down the wrong path in life, too dumb to know what they're going to regret in a decade's time.

There's no absolution, but there's sympathy. A lot of it, really.

All to say... we can look at the situations of both James and Snape and understand exactly how they got to the respective situations they're in. James' heroism was more or less foist upon him -- and Snape's uprbrining shoved him into a deep, dark hole that it would be truly incredible for him to climb out of. None of this really dampen's James' ultimate heroism, or exculpates Snape as an adult *who really ought to know better* by the time we meet him in the story. But... it's all quite interesting to think about. Snape as a character is a pretty good look into the mind, if you will, of a somewhat sympathetic Nazi -- a truly prejudiced and unkind person, but a person nonetheless. One that forces us to understand how he got to be the way he is, and how little of a chance he really had to be otherwise. 

It really highlights how *poorly* Voldemort is ultimately written. He's pretty much just a sociopath who was born evil, when it's possible there could have been a lot more sympathy realized in his backstory as a war orphan. Even his Book 1 incarnation that tries to make a philosophical point about power being the only valuable thing in the world kind of... drops the ball as the series goes on. 

But I'm digressing. Hope anyone who reads this enjoyed it. Edit: added a paragraph",52,2018-10-15 04:05:06,0.997
This pretty much sums up my unpopular opinion,,2018-10-14 16:58:53,14343,60,0.4939,"The thing is, James appears to have only ever become ""good"" because he was trying to get the girl (Lily) *too.* 

Something that's never really addressed in the Harry Potter series, except in passing and in moments of [fridge logic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic) after the fact, is that a lot of the characters who are supposedly on the ""good side"" of things, are actually bullies and assholes themselves. 

Fred and George are an excellent example. It seems like every other week someone brings up the fact that they were throwing snowballs at Voldemort's face, when he was stuck in the back of Quirrell's head. Often to everyone's great amusement. But consider for the moment that without Voldemort, this is just a couple of teenagers bullying a teacher who's clearly having some serious anxiety problems. Similarly, in their fifth year, both of these supposed good guys, very nearly kill another student when they shove him into a broken vanishing cabinet. Keep in mind his ""crime"" was trying to take points off from Gryffindor. This is a bit like attempted murder over getting your post downvoted on reddit.

There's every indication that James and Sirius are cut from the same cloth, and behaved in similar ways. We even see as much, given how they torture Snape repeatedly (and its implied that even after James ""reformed"" himself to get with Lily, he continued to do so.)

During Snape's memories, in book 7, we get this scene in which Dumbledore suggests that he thinks they ""sort too soon"", after calling Snape brave, and Snape looks strickened/upset (I forget the exact phrase used) by this. Why? Because Dumbledore, implicitly, offers an uncomfortable counterfactual that gets to the absolute heart of this whole debate, and Snape knows it.

Snape grows up poor, comes from an unhappy home, and the one bright spot in his life is his friendship/love of Lily. But then of course they end up in different houses; Snape gets thrown in with a bunch of people who are quite evil/bad/rotten inside, and because of all this, he himself ends up evil himself, especially after he loses his friendship with Lily, arguably the one thing that kept him from going completely dark. 

But suppose he *didn't* get sorted into Slytherin and thrown away from the only real friend he ever had (All things considered, Slytherin seems to be a den of ""old money"", and likely didn't like Snape, being poor, all that much either until he proved to be 'useful'). Suppose instead, as Dumbledore accidentally suggests, that he was sorted into Gryffindor.

I will be explicit here: I would expect Harry to be Severus' son in such an alternative universe. 

Lily's love-- or rather, the love that James and Snape have for her, pushed both of them towards goodness, and when he lost it, Snape (imo) was overcome by his circumstances and ended up fully committing to being a Dark Wizard, except for the spot he had for Lily. 

I don't wish to imply that Snape was somehow not a bad guy, or that he was some sort of reluctant Death Eater, but rather I think there was goodness in him, real goodness, that ultimately got destroyed because he had no one else to pull him out of it. ",344,2018-10-14 20:57:57,-0.9776

Kowalski is probably my favorite HP character ever. From the moment we meet him, he's one of those really good genial folks who is earning an honest living while trying to make his dreams a reality. He's completely out of his element the whole film, but he does everything he can to help anyway and ends up being a huge boon for Newt. 

Even at the end, with how sad he was to see Newt, Tina, and Queenie go he understands the need to wipe his memory for the sake of his friends.

Then though, even before Queenie shows up, the fact that his baked goods resemble all of the creatures that he saw with his good friend Newt makes me think that Kowalski has some sort of special trait within him that was stronger than the magic that wipes memories. Not some sort of magic, but maybe just a very pure, honest, and emotional sort of memory that magic really couldn't touch. 

Either way, he's like Samwise in Lord of the Rings. He was never 'destined' for anything, and he has no visibly exceptional traits at the start of his journey that would help the big major hero accomplish their goal. Even so, he helps because it is the right thing to do and ultimately he becomes a major source of support for the hero. 

I love that a kind no-maj Polish-American baker can be so incredibly special (historically so, in terms of the in-universe lore as MACUSA bans wizards and witches from interacting with non-magical folk) while being so incredibly modest. ",51,2018-02-18 10:24:22,0.9979

I was in Orlando for work, and I had 2 days to visit the park. I was alone, which felt a little weird as an adult, but I didn't really GAF. I got a robe, and a wand (though I didn't use it much bc there were so many kids there and I felt like a creep making kids wait in line so I could essentially play with a glorified remote control) and I loved it. 

I bought my robe at one of the gift shops on the way to Diagon Alley, so I was already wearing it when I walked through the barrier. (100% bought my wand at Ollivanders, though, obvs.)  But walking through the barrier and seeing everything and hearing music and all of it was just so incredible. The HP series really helped me through some very tough times in my life, so it already has emotions linked to it. So I legit got teary and overwhelmed for the first 10-15 minutes or so walking around Diagon Alley. 

And then some bitch (sorry, not sorry) on the Hogwarts Express said to me ""OMG are you really wearing that as an adult?""

Frustrated, I utter some choice curse words and a curious older man moves one bench down. I think nothing of it, adjust my lead and continue writing. 

As I look up to stretch the older man is gone. Nowhere in sight. ""Good"" I think to myself. ""Fucking creepers"". Then the lead breaks again. I start to tear up. This is my one day off from my stupid, insurance-less ""part time but youll never have a break on shift"" job. My one day to forget my real life and just write about anything. Why? Just fucking awesome. 

I start to take the pencil apart, slowly unscrewing the tip to see why my lead won't stay put. As I do this I hear a small pop. I just assume it's an animal or something and continue to disembowel my pencil. Then I notice a pair of very scuffed but sensible shoes. The rubber is peeling away but somehow the soles stay on the shoes. As if held there by magic.

""Fantastic"" the ginger mutters. ""You make words with this?"" He walks behind me, looking at the mess of parts on my paper. ""What do these different parts do? This one here"" he points to the spring I've removed ""looks like a baby Sprinky! I saw one before. Better watch out for them. These Sprinkies can jump from stairs and strangle you without notice!""

I look up at him...""Strangle? What? Ok...? It's just a broken pencil. No clue what's wrong."" And go back to my repair task. I chalk this comment up to another heroin junkie. Small towns, you know how it goes.

I realize he's still talking ""of course Mudungus thought he could train it. Well that Sprinky ended up trying to bite, erm, strangle the hand the fed it! Poor guy ended up in Mungo's for-""

""AURTHUR WEASLEY! YOU LEAVE THAT POOR MUGGLE ALONE!""

A short woman with a ginger look is storming up the sidewalk. This day is now better than anything on T.V. this junkies WIFE found him! And she's clutching a stick to beat his ass for doing drugs again!


I look over my shoulder to see who else is catching this show! Better than cable! I hear two tiny pops and when I look back though...the ginger couple is gone. I look both ways up the sidewalk. They were seriously just here. I start to collect my things to go home and notice my pencil is together again. I try it out and it works even better than before...

She read Harry Potter to us. I was about to start at a new school after being bullied at my old school. 

I was really scared about switching schools. 

Harry Potter not only gave me the bravery to make new friends, but I learned so much about standing up for what is right from those books. 


I am a serious Potterhead now, and I really think that those books helped shape me into the empathetic, strong and hard working person that I am today. 


-FRIENDS MOM- is on the other side of the curtain now and at her funeral it all hit me. She probably have me the most meaningful gift that I could ever receive-the love of reading, the gift of imagination, and magic. 


I wish that I could have thanked her properly, but who knows, maybe when she crossed over she gained the knowledge of all the impacts that she made while she was here. ",62,2018-09-05 15:02:42,0.991

""He gave Harry to an abusive family""
He did that because if by any chance Voldemort returned to kill him, he would still survive because of his mother's protection in his aunt's blood. But naaah, fuck his life, better put him in a place he'll become famous and possibly a dickhead. Explained in the order of the phoenix
""But the order was more than capable. He was protected in the last 3 books"". He was protected by the ministry. And up until book 6, the ministry didn't believe voldemort was back, so why put on protection against sth they believe isn't there? 


""Dumbledore should've told him sooner""
""Hey Harry, I'm glad youre finally enjoying in life and have friends. Altho you're just a kid, I just wanted you to know you're gonna die in a couple of years. (smiles) Time's ticking!""
He explains how in the first and second year, he saw harry rise so much into popularity that he didn't wanna ruin it, plus, he was still too young. In the third year, he finally found a living relative and again, harry was barely 13. In the fourth year, harry saw someone die right in front of him, saw the return of lord voldemort AND fought him. I'm guessing he wouldn't've told him in the fifth as well bcs of sirius but it was already time 4 it.
Explained in the order of the phoenix


Meme aside, looks like some people actually think dumbledore raised him like a pig for slaughter.
""For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore‚Äôs eyes."" - goblet of fire. 
Dumbledore already had an idea harry might survive and was doing everything he can to achieve that. Why didn't he tell him? I'd say he knew harry would sacrifice himself for the others, which would in return give them protection.

Harry and Neville wore clothes similar to their fathers during the Battle of Hogwarts,,2020-09-21 15:18:35,13802,64,-0.3818,"Both could be the chosen ones as both were born at the end of the seventh month and both's parents  defied voldemort thrice .... But voldemort marked Harry as his equal and gave him a power unknowingly ...... He made him his horcrux (maybe because like voldemort Harry was also a half-blood)


Now some people might start saying that no Neville was weak ... Blah blah ..... So in the books and wizarding world website i.e. the doctrine of wizarding World it is clearly written that the wand which Neville used untill year 5 was his father's wand ,  plus his father's wand's wood was ash (does not change loyalty) ..... So all the time till year 5 he was using a wrong wand ....... After then his wand broke and he went to  the ollivanders wand shop ... There he got his real wand and that was the reason why he was able to do magic properly since year 5 ...... It was made of cherry wood , the wood which is the 3rd rarest wood (just like Harry had Phoenix feather core which is the 3rd rarest core) ...... 

Both were Fierce in friendships .... Both wanted to kill voldemort not because of their personal grudge but to save the wizarding world ....both could draw the sword of gryffindor out of the sorting hat ..... 


Now some people would say that Neville wasn't brave he didn't even remember things .... But that was because he was considered a looser by everyone since the beginning .... People thought that he was a squib, a disgrace to his parents  .... That had a mental affect on him.


So this is what I have to say hope it is informative",331,2020-09-21 17:04:27,-0.937

And every movie afterward just kept hammering and hammering it further, giving a lot of his lines to Hermione and ruining the dynamic of the Golden Trio. 

Hermione is supposed to be Harry's smart friend who's knowledgeable about the Muggle world and logic but doesn't know a lot about the Wizarding world, while Ron is Harry's wizard best friend who's clueless about the Muggle world but grew up immersed in Wizarding world logic and has a dad who works for Wizarding Government.

It would bridge with characters of familiarity to the films and books, bringing in current fans. It would let us flesh out the back stories. Let us see the heyday of the Half-Blood Prince. Show us the Marauders and the eventual betrayal. Build the rivalries that became the backbone of the in-school conflicts we see the in books. 

Plus a series draws eyeballs to a streaming service and generates all sorts of merchandizing opportunity and even additions to places like the Wizarding World at Universal. 

You also don't need to worry about being compared to the original films and the performances of those actors.

I look at it this way. For every bit of hate that Voldemort threw out trying to kill Harry, Lily's love protected him. The first time it caused the spell to backfire and strike Voldemort's body. This last time, Harry was protected by his own sacrifice. He allowed himself to be ""killed"" - he willingly allowed Voldemort to shoot a killing curse at him with no expectation of survival in order to save the world. When he did survive, he understood that he could use that love to take down Voldemort. That the kind of love he felt was powerful enough to overcome hate. And you can't cast Avada Kedavra with hate. 

His goal was to stop Voldemort. He knew the wand was really his. He just had to call it. He pretty much knew what would happen. That the wand would not turn on it's true master and the spell would rebound on Voldemort, killing him for the last time. He knew he would be safe if he could time it right.

What should have happened,,2017-06-08 21:54:20,13606,46,0.0,"Let's also not forget that, at the time, there was no joint Sirius-and-Remus force. Remus was insanely distrustful of Sirius after the Snape Incident at Hogwarts, and they essentially weren't friends for a while. Remus admitted to have believed all along that Sirius had murdered Peter and betrayed Lily & James, because that's the Sirius that Remus remembered. Remus held a grudge for over a decade, and it also strained his relationship with James. 

Sirius may not have been totally aware of *why* exactly Dumbledore knew/felt it was so important to have Harry raised (and more importantly protected by) Petunia and Vernon. At the time, Sirius was also grieving for his best friend. He sincerely was not in the best position to be taking Harry in at 22 years old. *Especially* because he likely would've murdered Peter anyway if Peter hadn't faked the explosion. 

Sirius probably would've wound up in Azkaban either way, is all. 

edit: also Remus likely wasn't the most mentally stable person around the time Lily & James were murdered, either. I've no doubt that James met up with him during transformation times, but Wolfsbane wasn't easily available to him & insanely expensive. so I doubt Remus even had a potential stake in Harry's raising.

Voldemort got real creative when he was hiding the diadem,"Lucius: ‚ÄúWhere did you hide the locket, my lord?‚Äù  

Voldemort: ‚ÄúI put it at the bottom of a basin full of potion that you have to drink in order to get to it, but the potion makes you see and feel horrendous things, and also makes you crave water. The basin is on a small island in the middle of a dark lake, and the only water you can drink is from said lake. That lake is filled with a giant army of inferi which of course can only be stopped by fire. You can only get to the basin in the middle of the lake by taking a boat that‚Äôs hidden at the bottom, and you can only find the boat by pulling on an invisible chain. The lake is in a cavern protected by a door that is practically undetectable to the unsuspecting wizard. The door can only be opened if you cut yourself and splatter your blood on the door. Oh, and the door is inside a random cave that‚Äôs super hard to get to in the first place.‚Äù

Edit: Actually now that I think about it. The fact that Voldemort hid it in the Room of Hidden Things was pretty brilliant. Most of the people didn't know what they were looking for or that they were even looking for a Horcrux.

What sits wrong with me is that Dumbledore never figured it out while Luna offered it as a suggestion immediately and most Ravenclaws knew about it. Considering that Dumbledore interrogated obscure people, Muggles, house elves about their encounter with Tom Riddle but never thought to ask Flitwick or the ghosts from his own school seems rather stupid. Even if the Grey Lady was not able to give Harry the exact location in the books, he could have still been able to find out that Tom Riddle asked about it at some point. Dumbledore was way better with words than Harry.",1804,2021-03-26 11:38:17,0.1901

Voldemort: ‚ÄúLol I threw it in this random room I found at Hogwarts one time.‚Äù",2021-03-26 11:19:54,13566,107,-0.7278,"Clearly Slytherin's locket was his most prized horcrux and the only one he thought he really needed.  Dumbledore even tells Harry about how indifferent Voldemort was toward the diary as it was clearly meant as a weapon as well as to keep him alive.  I consider the safety of the horcruxes, in order of least protected to most protected, to be below.  

Harry - The unknown horcrux.  This is not even thought of as needing protection because Voldemort never suspects that Harry is a horcrux, even while ""killing"" the piece of soul within Harry.  So, I can't rank how this would actually fall as we can only suspect how Voldemort would have handled the situation if he knew.  I guess he still would have killed Harry, destroying the horcrux in the process, deciding the loss of a part of his soul was worth it to solidify his domination of the magical world.

The Diary - The least protected horcrux.  This was left in the care of Lucius and was intended to be used as a weapon to bring about the basilisk again and weaken Dumbledore/Hogwarts for Voldemort's eventual takeover.  

Nagini - Another weapon horcrux.  This one is used by Voldemort to carry out missions.  I rank this one higher than the Diary because Voldemort does not entrust Nagini to anyone else's care.  She is always connected to him, even out on missions, and he is most aware of her existence at all times out of all of the horcruxes.

The Ring - buried in some dirt in the floor of his families shack of a house. The ring has a curse on it that will kill someone who wears it.  Definitely not very protected for something that is supposed to house a piece of a person's soul.

The Diadem - I consider this the third most protected horcrux.  Although Voldemort was the world's biggest idiot to believe no one else had discovered the Room of Requirement and never learned of it's true potential, there were tons of piles of stuff in the room to make it lss likely anyone would find and take the diadem or destroy it.  This is much less protected than the Cup as many people have access to the room of requirement compared to a high security Gringott's vault that the owners knew the diadem was Voldemort's and wouldn't touch it.  The chances of a random student finding the diadem in the room of requirement, taking a liking too it, discovering that it is Ravenclaw's lost diadem, and someone eventually discovering what it had become are higher.  Only the shear amount of items that are also in the room to hide the diadem from discovery make this safer than the ring in my opinion.  

Hufflepuff's Cup - left in Bellatrix's high security vault at Gringott's.  I would say this is the second most protected horcrux.  It is very unlikely that anyone would be able to get into the vault and steal it.  At the same time, if a LeStrange who had access to the vault discovered what it was and wanted to turn on Voldemort, they could easily access this.  Putting a horcrux in the care of a Death Eater is pretty careless for Voldemort who trusts and relies on no one.

The locket - as said in the post, very well protected and really the only one to be so protected.  

Given this information, I really think that the locket is the only horcrux Voldemort really cares about.  As the only living descendent of Slytherin, he sees it as his rightful heirloom and proves his connection to who he sees as the greatest wizard in history and a validation of his right to become even greater and rule over the world, both magical and muggle.  The rest are neat, powerful artifacts, many of which are associated with Hogwarts founders, who he has a great respect for.  As you can see, the other most protected horcruxes are Hufflepuff's and Ravenclaw's heirlooms.  I would suspect that if he had Gryffindor's sword, he would have turned it into a horcrux and protected it as much as Hufflepuff's cup or slightly more to put it in second place.  Maybe he even intended to make it into a horcrux with Harry's death, had Harry, Ron, and Hermione not ""stolen"" it from the vault with the cup.",105,2021-03-26 13:45:39,0.9845

Dumbledore knew Harry very well and knew that he is the closest with Ron. So Dumbledore maybe suggested him. With Cedric he suggested Cho because she was his date to the ball/his girlfriend and he really cared for her. 

With Fleur I think Maxime could have suggested her sister because she knew they were close (and that Fleur didn't have a lot of real, close friends in her school). 

For Krum I think Karkarov just didn't care enough and suggested the first person that came to mind - his ball date.

>‚ÄúGranger, Professor \[Binns\],‚Äù \[said Hermione.\] ‚ÄúI was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,‚Äù said Hermione in a clear voice.  
>  
>\[‚Ä¶\] ‚ÄúPlease, sir, don‚Äôt legends always have a basis in fact?‚Äù  
>  
>\[‚Ä¶\] ‚ÄúThe Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?‚Äù Hermione said.  
>  
>\[‚Ä¶\] **‚ÄúI think,‚Äù said Hermione, ‚Äúthat if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, \[academically\], we might stand a chance \[of getting the information\]‚Ä¶‚Äù**  
>  
>\[‚Ä¶\] ‚ÄúEr ‚Äî Professor Lockhart?‚Äù Hermione stammered. ‚ÄúI wanted to ‚Äî to get this book out of the library. Just for background reading.‚Äù  
>  
>She held out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly.  
>  
>‚ÄúBut the thing is, it‚Äôs in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it ‚Äî **I‚Äôm sure it would help me understand what you say** in *Gadding with Ghouls* about slow-acting venoms‚Äî‚Äù

Harry later recognizes Tom Riddle using this tactic due to Hermione in *Half-Blood Prince*.

>‚ÄúSir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?‚Äù \[Riddle\] asked.  
>  
>‚ÄúTom, Tom, if I knew, I couldn‚Äôt tell you,‚Äù said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. **‚ÄúI must say, I‚Äôd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.‚Äù**  
>  
>Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.  
>  
>\[‚Ä¶\] ‚ÄúSir, I wanted to ask you something‚Ä¶.I wonder what you know about Horcruxes?‚Äù  
>  
>\[‚Ä¶\] ‚ÄúProject for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?‚Äù  
>  
>‚ÄúNot exactly, sir,‚Äù said Riddle. ‚Äú**I came across the term while reading, and I didn‚Äôt fully understand it**‚Ä¶but you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you - sorry, I mean, if you can‚Äôt tell me, obviously - I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could - so I‚Äôd just thought I‚Äôd ask -‚Äù  
>  
>**It was very well-done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people \[after Hermione had taught him\] not to recognize a master at work.**  
>  
>He could tell that Riddle wanted this information very, very much; perhaps \[Riddle\] had been working towards this moment for weeks.  
>  
>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Slughorn, \[‚Ä¶\] ‚Äúwell, it can‚Äôt hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term‚Ä¶‚Äù  
>  
>\[‚Ä¶\] **‚ÄúI don‚Äôt quite understand how that works, though, sir,‚Äù said Riddle.**  
>  
>\[‚Ä¶\] ‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù said Riddle. **‚ÄúWhat I don‚Äôt understand, though -** **just out of curiosity** \-‚Äù  
>  
>\[‚Ä¶\] **‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù \[Slughorn\] muttered, ‚Äúthis is all hypothetical, what we‚Äôre discussing, isn‚Äôt it? All academic‚Ä¶‚Äù**  
>  
>**‚ÄúYes, sir, of course,‚Äù said Riddle quickly.**

Additionally, Harry also caught Hermione admiring spell work by Riddle in *Order of the Phoenix*.

>\[‚Ä¶\] **Harry looked sideways at Hermione.**  
>  
>‚ÄúYou know what these remind me of?‚Äù  
>  
>‚ÄúNo, what‚Äôs that?‚Äù \[Hermione asked innocently.\]  
>  
>‚ÄúThe Death Eaters‚Äô scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all their scars burn, and they know they‚Äôve got to join him.‚Äù  
>  
>**‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶yes,‚Äù said Hermione quietly, ‚Äúthat is where I got the idea. \[From Tom Riddle / Lord Voldemort\].** But you‚Äôll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal, rather than on our members‚Äô skin.‚Äù",197,2021-06-17 20:14:30,0.9203

However, this plan accomplished more than just moving Harry from point A to point B. 

First of all, it made Snape look like a valuable spy to Voldemort. By passing on some details of the plan but not others he was able to prove his value to Voldemort even though his cover had been burned in the previous book. This may not seem like much, but doing so sets Snape up to become Headmaster at Hogwarts come September, and allows him to protect the school from the likes of the Carrows. 

Secondly, it confuses the Death Eaters to the actual location that Harry gets moved too. With Seven Potters flying to Seven Safehouses they no longer know where to attack. So, when they finally take over the ministry and can break the enchantments around the safehouses, they have to split their forces up and search all seven, as opposed to simply surrounding one place and collapsing on it with their full force. 

Thirdly, they once again manage a blow against Voldemort's reputation and undermine his power and sow doubt among his followers. By having Harry escape in full view of death eaters, Voldemort can't hide the fact that he has failed to kill Harry again, and was still being outsmarted by Dumbledore even though he's dead. 

None of the ideas you suggested would have kept Harry any safer than the plan of the seven potters. Most of them would rely on the Death Eaters not knowing about the order needing to move Harry, but we already know that they are aware and they haven't taken the bait of the false trail. Polyjuice potion wouldn't work if they were watching for Harry to Leave, they would know the second the enchantment failed he was trying to escape. The Dursley's leave before Harry because the enchantment protecting them doesn't break until Harry Leaves, so Harry leaving after them buys them extra time to get away safely. If anyone moved Harry using Illegal Methods they would be arrested by the people working for Voldemort in the ministry and be held as hostages against Harry. Transfiguration wouldn't work because they were watching for Harry to leave, any member of the order would have been intercepted once they carried Harry far enough from the house to break the enchantment. 

&#x200B;

Finally, you have to keep in mind that while you the reader have information, either from the narration or in retrospect, at the time the characters making these decisions wouldn't have had that information and it doesn't make sense to assume that they would act on this information. For Example Harry's Cloak: Normal Invisibility cloaks can be detected by using spells, if the person searching knows that a wizard is using one nearby, and Harry's Cloak is common knowledge. No one Alive at the start of the Seventh book, when the Night of the Seven Potters takes places, knows that Harry's cloak is a hallow, and will give him added defense against said detection spells, not even Harry and Hermione. So the Order wouldn't rely on Harry's Cloak to protect him once the enchantment broke.",1404,2020-08-31 05:22:06,-0.9948

They didn't know it was a Hallow,  as far as the Order knew it was just a regular invisibility cloak which was not infallible. They'd already lost one of Moody's cloaks at the Ministry in Order of the Phoenix (Sturgis Podmore was using it when he was arrested while guarding the Department of Mysteries). Leaving Harry to fend for himself with nothing but an invisibility cloak would be suicide.

>Why not have him use Polyjuice Potion?

They know the Death Eaters aren't aiming to kill Harry, but they *will* aim to kill anyone else. Having more people disguised as Harry is actually safer. If anything they should have gone for 14 Potters!

>Why not have him leave with the Dursleys and then Apparate alongside Dedalus or Hestia once they were far enough away? Why not just ignore the Ministry and set up an illegal Portkey (Dumbledore did it several times and nothing happened‚Äîdo they even have a way to track this)? Why not have Moody transfigure Harry into a ferret and carry him in his pocket?

All of these ideas are explained by Harry's Trace; the Order knows the Ministry has been compromised, so somebody will be keeping an eye on him. The Ministry will know of any spells that are cast within Harry's vicinity and would be able to track a Portkey or Apparition.

As Moody says in The Seven Potters: ""We're going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can't detect, because we don't need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid's motorbike.""",99,2020-08-31 05:42:35,-0.9718

Not only because this type of car came out in a movie, but this car of its age needs to preserved. If I'm not mistaken, they didn't make that many of this type from what I read; Ford Anglia 105E -1960. And a very lesser amount we're sold in the States. 

Beautiful car nonetheless! Anything that comes from the late 50's and early 60's are becoming so much more harder to find.

I've studied acting and theater and watching him is a study into how an actor can change the flat words into a living person.

His casting as Snape was perfect even before I saw him in the role and before we knew the full Harry Potter story. 

He was what we call an actors actor. He worked to make everyone around him look good, to serve the story. He had a passion for the art of acting and bringing others up. 

His death hit me hard because I knew that we'd come to the end of watching him work.

His love of acting was in his every performance, that's what made him spark in film and stage. And like most of the other ""greats"" in the business he knew that the success of the end result wasn't just made up by him but by the sum of everyone involved.",258,2021-02-21 15:46:45,0.8689

She couldn‚Äôt understand why I was bawling at Snape‚Äôs death until Harry went into Snape‚Äôs memories. It was really weird to watch her react because even the first time I saw DH2 I knew what was going to happen. She really thought Snape was the bad guy right up until the end. She was floored, beyond shocked and kept muttering ‚Äúnow that makes sense‚Äù to herself. She also couldn‚Äôt get over what a fantastic actor Rickman was, even when being a complete and utter asshole, he was still somewhat likeable, he had you hanging on not just every word but every single syllable.

She also was distraught when Harry went into the forest, again she didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen, she thought that Harry was really going to die to save everyone else.

Philosopher's Stone: Harry suspects Snape a teacher, and instead it was Quirrell. So didn't suspect Malfoy and it wasn't a new mysterious teacher...

Prisoner of Azkaban: Suspects Sirius, but it was Peter Pettigrew.

Goblet of Fire: Sort of half suspects Karkaroff, but it was Barty Jr. disguised as the mysterious (but not dark) new teacher.

Order of the Phoenix: Doesn't really suspect anyone. Always clear that Umbridge and Voldemort are the main enemies.

Half Blood Prince: Suspects Malfoy and Snape, turns out to be Malfoy and Snape (and later revealed that the latter did it on Dumbledore's orders).

Henry VIII's wife (the second one) was Anne Boleyn and she was rumoured to have had six fingers on her right hand. In the day, extra digits were symbols of witchcraft and may well get you burned at the stake by an angry mob. She also had a cyst on her neck which looked like a nipple (another symbol of witchcraft), jaundiced skin (witchcraft...). Henry VIII got himself excommunicated from the entire Christian Church, by the Pope himself, for a witch?

We get most of this from Nicholas Sanders, a Catholic priest who also described her as ""handsome to look at"", the medieval way of saying ""smokin' hot"". Sanders had his own agenda going on here, though. He was a Roman Catholic in the Protestant England. Mary I, also known as Bloody Mary, had overseen many pogroms against Protestants, now her sister was on the throne and protestant herself. Nick thought a great idea was to make out Queen Elizabeth's mother was a witch.

An ambassador from Venice had described Anne as short, with unpleasant skin and unsupported breasts, because Henry VIII had just told him to go shove his trade treaty.

Her skeleton was exhumed in the 1800s, and she had no extra fingers anywhere. 

As for Nick's book? Published and penned 50 years after Anne's death. Mr. Sanders had never seen her and does not represent a primary source.",32,2020-11-16 12:04:24,-0.9438

Seen at the International Women‚Äôs March,,2020-03-08 13:15:25,12650,122,0.0,"I like how they say *book* 1, when you just *know* they are basing this entirely on the films.

Let's not forget how in the book any times Ron was useful, provided knowledge, or emotional grounding, that in the films it was either eliminated altogether or just handed over to Hermione.

Ron knows far more about the wizarding world or wizarding culture than Hermione, and often explains something to both her and Harry, particularly in the earlier books. Hermione doesn't know what a 'Mudblood' is in CoS, just that it's clearly some sort of slur, Ron has to tell her. It just doesn't logically fit that Hermione would know more than someone who lived in the wizarding world his whole life, no matter how much she has read in the summer holidays before Hogwarts.

Hermione is panicking just as much in the Devil's snare, considering needing *wood* to light a fire and Ron has to calm her down and point out that she's a witch. They dilute Ron down to at best a bumbling sidekick and at worst grossly incompetent. He gets similar grades to Harry in academia, but in the films it's as though Harry is amazing and Ron is useless.

Ron stands up to Snape when the latter deducts points to Hermione for being an 'insufferable know-it-all' pointing out that he asked a question and she knows the answer. He praises Hermione for her spellwork in the DA meetings (in the films he does the macho ""I'll go easy on you""). He stands on a *broken ankle* between Sirius and Harry in the PoA and threatens to kill the supposed mass murderer if he wants to kill Harry - this is swapped to Hermione in the film.

The list is endless. There's no doubt that Hermione is a genius and they'd be screwed without her, but she is NOT an infallible, all-knowing ""Mary-Sue"". Ron is awesome too, and a fiercely loyal friend. He got screwed over in the films.",488,2020-03-08 15:07:08,-0.8944

It is one thing to be excited about a strong female character. It is another thing to imply that the actual hero of the book is not a strong character because of the female. Harry saved everyone by his bravery and he also was skilled in magic in ways Hermione could never do. He was also smart. Just because he was not top of class does not him dumb or at the bottom. He had no school work ethic because doing papers is boring. He used his knowledge to problem solve ALONG SIDE her. He was exceptional at magic used for battle.,207,2020-03-08 13:30:56,0.7276

Watching the movies, I never really understood that scene- that memory of Snape where James was making him fly in the air and mocking him. I thought, maybe I didn't understand? Maybe it was just a one-time thing? But reading the book, I see clearly the type of person he is! Arrogant! Mean! He is a bully! He took Snape as his victim and behaved horribly towards him. Why does everyone want to make him seem like the perfect nice wizard? We didn't get the opportunity to know him as an adult, but I am shocked by his behavior! Snape was right from A to Z about him. He was a true victim. That scene in the park where he was just minding his own business and reading, and Black and Potter came to him to humiliate him in front of others just because they were bored‚Ä¶ crazy to me! Not saying that Snape is a good person!! But James Potter WAS A BULLY! He is worse than Malfoy at that time. I. Don‚Äôt. Like. Him. ! ",2024-04-25 18:29:00,12446,134,-0.9881,"Lily didn‚Äôt like him either. She called him ‚Äúan arrogant toe rag.‚Äù 
But he did have a crush on Lily. However, it seems while one headed in a very dark direction & then as Lily says ‚Äúevil‚Äù as she cuts him off from friendship; it seems the other started to mature as he aged; & started to see the error of his ways. Lily is a very empathetic human & doesn‚Äôt seem the type to be taken in by some arrogant bully. Something must‚Äôve changed in James, to cause Lily to fall in love with him. Also James & Lily became ‚Äúfamous‚Äù in the wizarding world due to their steadfast fight against dark wizards & Voldemort ‚Äúthrice defying him.‚Äù
But even Sirius recognized what they did & said to Peter ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve known about you back then. You weren‚Äôt our friends, you just delighted in surrounding yourself around stronger people to watch them bully others‚Äù or however it was worded in POA.
Even Harry is really disturbed at watching his father bully Snape. Even after he found out he cringed knowing it was coming when he was looking at Snape‚Äôs memories thru the pensive.
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs tough to see your father that way; someone you not only idolize, but you are constantly compared to.

Again, Lily was witness to at least 1 of these acts as she stepped in to defend Snape & that‚Äôs when Snape called her a ‚Äúfilthy mud blood.‚Äù 

People change & mature. Tho Snape questions the sincerity in the act; Dumbledore does not as he tells Harry that James saved Snape‚Äôs life. 
Many people that knew them both well seemed to know James both as a teen & a man; & they tend to like the adult James. This is a pretty strong indication, along with Lily ability to fall for him, that he truly changed. Lupin was one of those people. He did not participate in the bullying but he was witness to it.
He had great things to say about James as a man.
But even as a kid, James doesn‚Äôt seem like Malfoy. When Sirius was having trouble as a kid; James seemed to make him part of the family; as Ron did with Harry.
People are complex; especially FICTIONAL characters. All I can say is I wish JK Rowling revealed more details into the story of how Lily ended up going from thinking James an arrogant toe rag bully; to someone to marry & father a child with. Something changed & everyone deserves a 2nd chance. That‚Äôs one of the lessons of this book. The Malfoys were given a 2nd chance. & Even Voldemort was offered a chance at remorse by Harry; his total enemy; before his death. Even Albus Dumbledore, the wise mentor; who took down 2 of the darkest wizards of the ages; & saved Harry in the process, & saved Draco‚Äôs soul; Albus was planning world domination with his lover & trying to hide his ill sister under an invisibility cloak & take her around the world doing so.. which led to a fight where she died. 
He seemed to spend the rest of his life avoiding power & trying to make amends for such things.
This story is about human mistakes & being remorseful to try to make amends; aka paths of redemption; as much as it is about the power of Love & the secret hero magical journey against evil.",29,2024-04-25 22:25:56,0.959

He sees Molly what? 2 out of 52 weeks a year? And then a Christmas present? No letters during the rest, no asking how he's doing, or ask about his hopes, his dreams, what he likes and dislikes.. No support or love outside of those times. 

And Sirius was not in a good place. Maybe if he would have been able to go out and recover and heal properly, but even though he tried, he wasn't a good enough parent figure.

Never, after this are brooms ever summoned to their riders hand like this. You never see Harry saying ""up"" to any of the brooms he rides again. Nor does anyone else we ever see ride brooms.

Fans who hate Dumbledore for ‚Äúraising Harry like a pig for slaughter‚Äù are forgetting something,"We are seeing that conversation in Snape‚Äôs memory, and Dumbledore simply did not tell Snape the full story. He never told anyone the whole story until he told it to Harry in the King‚Äôs Cross chapter. 

From the end of GoF, Dumbledore knew, or rather, he was extremely confident that Harry could no longer die by Voldemort‚Äôs hand. That is what the look of triumph in his eyes was when Harry told him about the blood Voldemort took from him. From that moment on, Dumbledore was trying to orchestrate a situation that would lead to Voldemort‚Äôs downfall with the least amount of sacrifice necessary. And he knew that in order to do that, Harry would need to sacrifice himself willingly. Not be told to die for others, but choose to of his own free will. 

Dumbledore could have had other very trustworthy people destroy the horcruxes. He had an entire group of highly devoted and skilled wizards at his disposal. But he needed it to be Harry - he needed Harry to see and fully understand what a perversion it was to seek immortality. Dumbledore leading the trio to the Deathly Hallows was also never meant to shield Harry from death - he was already protected. The Hallows were just meant to push Harry towards the inevitable conclusion: that the mastery of death is really the acceptance of death. If Harry understood this message, the choice would come naturally to him. 

He knew Harry couldn‚Äôt die. But if Harry thought he could, and chose to, the sacrifice magic would shield everyone in the second leg of the Battle, preventing many more casualties. The final thing to do was not to fight Voldemort with skill and power, but with the one thing he never understood, but which Harry had in spades: love for others.

That‚Äôs why he never told Snape, he wanted Harry to receive only partial information. He didn‚Äôt care if that made him a villain in Snape‚Äôs eyes, as long as it led to Harry choosing to die willingly. It was the ultimate ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù, but so very different from how Grindelwald used the term. Dumbledore sacrificed everything, including his life, but he won, as everything worked out as he thought or even better than he thought it would.

I am sorry if this was discussed before, but I am seeing a lot of mindless hate for Dumbledore based off that quote. It seems to have become almost a default opinion in the fandom that Dumbledore was cruel and uncaring for orchestrating Harry‚Äôs death. That he didn‚Äôt give him a choice (when in fact Harry‚Äôs choice was the instrumental part).

He's genuinely happy and relieved that Voldemort can lose without Harry needing to die.

It's made explicitly clear that Dumbledore was willing to do many things for the Greater Good. Albus did not know Harry would survive until Goblet of Fire. Even still, he moved Harry like a chess piece toward his endgame, where Harry would die but so would Voldemort.

Is it good that Dumbeldore molded Harry as soon as he got his hands on him? No, it's horrifying. Snape was right in his reaction, almost nothing he has done is as sinister as this. 

Was it necessary, and artfully done? Hell yes.

Think about this. Dumbeldore had more than one reason to leave Harry out of the Wizarding World. Essentially, Dumbeldore recieved Harry as an unmolded lump of clay. Harry saw a father figure in Albus, and Dumbeldore used his every opportunity to shape Harry into the sword he needed.

>""Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,"" said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, ""Dumbledore's man through and through, aren't you, Potter?""

Scrimgeor saying things like this and that Harry is ""Dumbeldore's man through and through"" is more than him just being an asshole. Rowling wants us to know that, yes, Harry is--and it might not be as healthy as we presume. Snape realizes that Dumbledore was taking advantage of Harry's love for the old man, and when Harry tells Dumbledore that he is Dumbeldore's man,

>Dumbledore's bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.

>""I am very touched, Harry.""

The man is clearly wracked with love for the boy and shame at what he's doing.

Harry's arc in Deathly Hallows is just realizing the extent of Dumbeldore's manipulations, and how far he'd go to beat Voldemort. This quote becomes doubly heartbreaking:

>""He loved you,"" Hermione whispered. ""I know he loved you.""

>Harry dropped his arms.

>""I don't know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn't love, the mess he's left me in.""

But in the end, due partly to Dumbeldore, and wholly to Harry's strength as a boy and a man and a wizard--they win. Dumbeldore's plan worked. The ends may have justified the means--who knows how many boys and girls Harry's age and younger would have died underneath Voldemort's reign, had Albus not molded Harry from the beginning. Albus is complicated, but when he sees Harry again and says these words, you know he means them:

>""Harry."" He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. ""You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.""",336,2020-04-09 14:43:07,0.9961

Dumbledore was a good man who tried his best to fight for good, but had times when he fell short or was otherwise caught in the kind of situation where what was ‚Äògood‚Äô wasn‚Äôt black and white. 

I mean, is it ethical to protect one person from their natural fate of death if it means that preventing them from dying will cause thousands of other people to die and suffer? 

That was the situation Dumbledore was given because Harry was *always* going to have to face off against Voldemort no matter what Dumbledore did. There is no, ‚Äòpig for the slaughter‚Äô, it was inevitable because Voldemort chose to follow the prophecy and make it self-fulfilling.
It was always just a matter of when.

He could *try* to stop Harry from doing so, but if he did then Voldemort also would also never be defeated, and while he was alive he would continue his campaign of genocide against not only those who opposed him, but also innocent people like the muggles he wanted to rule over and the muggleborns who he and his followers wanted to commit genocide against.

How could he in good conscience then, choose to protect just Harry versus protecting the whole rest of the world just because he knew Harry and cared about him as a child? So Dumbledore‚Äôs solution was to try to give Harry as many tools and protections as he could because he couldn‚Äôt stop the inevitable, while also not sacrificing the rest of the world either. 

And the fact that he tried his damnedest to protect both is what makes him a good person in my eyes because I understand that it was a bad situation itself.

Part of my assessment of Dumbledore is also the fact that while the fandom for some reason thinks he‚Äôs like a god or something who controls and manipulates everything, Dumbledore himself was just a man who was both forced by necessity but also proudly took on the responsibility of protecting the Wizarding world. He wasn‚Äôt infallible; he had limits to his judgments and understanding of situations just like everyone else. He just had a lot more intelligence to go around so it always seemed that he had more control over the situation than he actually did. And part of this is that he was written to flip-flop between being super knowing while also not being perfect. 

But the concept that Dumbledore is the chess master (versus someone forced by fate) is because of an overestimation of how much control over the situation he had; the honest answer is not much, but people were looking to him to keep things under control.",63,2020-04-09 14:49:22,0.9906

I mean, what's one life against the rest of the world?  It would suck for Harry being the one sacrificed but it's objectively a good trade.  Dumbledore also sacrificed himself, technically twice so it's not like he's asking things of others that he's not willing to do himself.  He (I assume) knew that destroying the horcrux would kill him, then had Snape speed things along to protect Malfoy.  

I like this interpretation because it makes him a bit less of a paragon of heroism and more like what he was - a general leading an army against Voldemort that occasionally has to sacrifice the lives of those under his command.

Now he did give Harry a way out but there was always a solid chance Harry didn't figure it out and you have to think that Dumbledore had considered that and still thought it was worth the risk",13,2020-04-09 15:55:40,0.7564

First, if I remember the scene correctly, Dumbledore‚Äôs triumph was immediately followed by a much less triumphant look.  It could be that he realized he needed to put on an act for Snape. But to me it seemed the look of triumph was Dumbledore realizing his theories and been right, and the next reaction was him realizing his theories being right meant that Harry would have to die. I think you are totally right though that Dumbledore at some point figured out a different plan where Harry didn‚Äôt die but needed to think he would.

Second, your comment about using Snape confuses me. Dumbledore could have given partial information to anyone. He chose Snape because he needed someone to carry the information after his own death, and Snape was his most reliable and trusted agent. Dumbledore, as a repentant former evildoer himself, understands and trusts Snape. He also knows Snape is coldly capable of doing what must be done no matter how distasteful.

But he was the furthest thing from cruel.",2020-04-09 13:11:39,12153,179,-0.9893,"That one quote isn't the only reason I have issues with Dumbledore's approach.  He proved himself to be incredibly manipulative throughout the series.  While his intentions were good, his implementation of those intentions were not.

1. Aberforth said Dumbledore ""learned secrecy at our mother's knee.  Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up, and Albus was a natural ... people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans ... many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he'd left 'em well alone"" (Deathly Hallows 561, 562).  Even with whatever bias Aberforth had, this is an accurate assessment.
2. Dumbledore admits this to Harry in King's Cross when he says, ""I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine"" (Deathly Hallow 715 - 716).  This is a Dumbledore who no longer has anything to hide and is finally being honest with Harry about who he is.
3. When Harry returns to Hogwarts for the last time, he has to choose between being secretive like Dumbledore or trusting the rest of Dumbledore's Army (a fascinating parallel to Harry's choice between Gryffindor and Slytherin when he first got to Hogwarts!)  Just like with the Sorting Hat, Harry chooses Gryffindor qualities over the Slytherin qualities we had learned Dumbledore had possessed.
4. His lack of action in Harry's childhood, despite knowing what the Dursley's were doing to him, made him complicit in the abuse he suffered.  He even tells Harry that he knew he ""was condemning you \[Harry\] to ten dark and difficult years"" (Order of the Phoenix 835) when he left Harry with the Dursleys.  There are plenty of ways Dumbledore could have arranged for Harry to be treated well while allowing the Dursleys to have the appearance of normality that they wanted.  Dumbledore even said he only had to ""return there only once a year, but as long as you still call it home, there he cannot hurt you"" (Phoenix 836).  This means Dumbledore knew he did not have to spend his entire childhood with the Dursleys, yet he condemned him to a decade of constant abuse.
5. Mrs. Figg said she did nothing about the abuse under ""Dumbledore's orders.  I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young.  I'm sorry I gave you such a miserable time, but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they'd thought you enjoyed it."" (Phoenix 22).  Not only did Dumbledore do nothing to make it better, he sent one of his agents into Harry life and actively made it worse.  The abuse he suffered became worse because of Dumbledore's machievellian plans.
6. Professor McGonagall even warned Dumbledore about the Dursleys.  Yet he made no adjustments to his plans, even though he was warned about how terrible they were.
7. Dumbledore's secrecy is seen throughout the series.  one of the clearest examples is why Dumbledore never makes eye contact with Harry in Order of the Phoenix.  He could have written a letter to Harry or had Professor McGonagall speak to Harry on his behalf.  She'd be a perfect person to do this since she was head of Gryffindor and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.  This would have saved Harry from needless stress, provided him with necessary answers, and given Harry to become much more agency in his own life.  It also would have gone a long way in helping Harry understand Voldemort's goals with the Department of Mysteries, allowing Harry and friends to avoid the dangers of being attacked by Death Eaters.  While Harry was protected by love, Sirius clearly wasn't.  Dumbledore's secrecy was a major factor in putting the Order in danger, leading to Sirius' death.  Just like the Dursleys exerted control over Harry by keeping him ignorant of his magical heritage, Dumbledore exerts control over Harry by keeping him ignorant of what is happening.
8. There's also his involvement with Grindelwald, which I don't have the time to talk about at the moment!

While Dumbledore's plan worked, it worked ONLY because Harry broke free of his secrecy and decided to trust people when he returned to Hogwarts.  He trusted the DA and McGonagall.  If he hadn't, he never would have known to go after the Ravenclaw diadem.

I find Dumbledore to be one of the most fascinating characters in the series, but he has some pretty huge flaws.  While this adds to his complexity and makes him more fascinating, it also prevents him from being the idealized wizard so many make him out to be.",72,2020-04-09 15:35:02,0.4385

now that im thinking about it, it doesnt make much sense. if the explosion was so bad that it destroyed his body then harry wouldve been injured at the very least

this is also weird on how hagrid & sirius were able to get to the house & leave before the ministry came to clean up the scene. dumbledore & the order most likely were keeping tabs on the potters (and ppl like batilda bagshot couldve reported an explosion at the house) but how come the ministry wasnt informed of it by other wizards living in godrics hollow?",530,2019-03-02 14:20:08,-0.7967

If you think about it, the early 20th century must have been a strange time for wizards. New technology was suddenly enabling muggles to do things that had previously only been attainable by magic. Some wizards might have looked at this as a sign that the magic and muggle worlds could come together soon, and they wanted to mainstream themselves more.

Why didn't Voldemort make a Horcrux out of a grain of sand and chunk it into the ocean? Because he's the coolest wizard in the land who gave Death the middle finger, and so every Horcrux has to be something special or important.

at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs; how
he had done it - how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so
much as a scratch on him - nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had
returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody
really knew what was wrong with her, either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and
there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.

The only book the chick has for me to read tho is the god damn Harry potter series so I'm like fuck really? And she tells me it's ether I look at the wall or I read about a wizard. Harry potter is and has been my favorite book/series 10 years later and honestly if Debbie didn't give me the option to choose from looking at the wall and reading it I probably would've never had read it.

Last year I was walking down a NYC subway platform (50th St, I think?). It was late, poor weather, and a weeknight, so the place was completely empty. Then I see two young guys - one taking a photo of the other - who was standing in front of a Jersey Boys poster with the widest grin and a joyfully enthusiastic thumbs up. He was scraggly and blonde and it made me pause and smile because - honestly I'd never seen someone so enthusiastic about Jersey Boys. I figured maybe he was a boy from Jersey and was amused by the poster - or maybe he was a young actor who had just been cast in the show.

It turns out it was not a boy from Jersey, but it was an actor. Tom Felton, who posted the photo on his Instagram the next day. And whose bright goofy smile caught my eye and stayed with me, even when I had no idea that he was not just a random boy on the subway platform.",112,2020-10-19 19:19:34,0.9434

I think the books do a far better job of showing his skill as a wizard growing and him becoming more powerful as the books went on than the films do. And in the books there are multiple moments that show he‚Äôs more advanced than his peers.

For example, I think of how in the ‚ÄúOrder of the Phoenix‚Äù book, Professor Tofty, who is the proctor for Harry‚Äôs Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL, is like, I heard through the grapevine that you can produce a patronus‚Ä¶ could you do it for some extra credit? And Harry obliges. And Professor Tofty is absolutely beside himself that a 15 year old can produce a corporeal patronus like that‚Ä¶ let alone a 13 year old being able to do it, which is when he actually learned the spell, and hold off hundreds of dementors with it no less.

There‚Äôs a lot of moments like this that show that Harry is exceptional among his peers. As in, he‚Äôs an especially talented wizard in comparison to others his age. Sometimes he lacks discipline, whether typical school age ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt wanna do my homework‚Äô, or caused by the external stress he‚Äôs constantly under, but he‚Äôs definitely exceptionally talented for his age.

And he ALSO has a lot of luck. For example, were it not for the twin cores and priori incantatem in the graveyard, and all the other magic that Harry had no part in doing that intertwined Voldemort and Harry, Voldemort absolutely would‚Äôve succeeded in killing him in that moment. Because at 14, Harry was not yet skilled enough to take him on. So luck played a big part in it as well.

And then of course, a huge part of how he was able to defeat Voldemort were skills that didn‚Äôt have anything to do with magic‚Ä¶

His bravery, his wit and quick thinking, his being a natural leader, his loyalty, and of course, him being a good friend and having friends who wanted to be in the trenches with him because he was a good friend. And these were the ineffable things that Voldemort could never understand, which helped lead to Harry‚Äôs success.",59,2024-10-27 15:48:50,0.9964
"Was Harry Potter actually an especially powerful and talented Wizard, or were most of his accomplishments just based on circumstance and luck? ",,2024-10-27 14:30:36,11848,247,0.8643,"Harry was definitely both powerful and talented and I'd even argue that his circumstances often held him back in his personal development as a wizard - I think that his experiences made him somewhat jaded over time and he lost his sense of wonder for learning new types of magic.   
He obviously wasn't as intelligent as Hermione, let alone Dumbledore or Riddle, but he definitely had the raw talent to become one of the best ""normal"" wizards.

Anyway, luck and circumstance didn't help him when he: 

\- summoned one of the most powerful Patronuses - if not **the** most powerful one - we see in the franchise

\- competed in the TWT (yes, he had assistance but so did the other champions and his only real advantage was during the third task)

\- chose to face Voldemort head-on after everything he had endured

\- proofed himself superior to his peers in DADA in every year that matters

\- learned and later taught defensive that many adults struggled with (e.g. Protego)

\- held his own against adult dark wizards and witches that were amongst the best in Voldemort's ranks

\- Side-along Apparated Dumbledore over hundreds of miles and incapacitated several DEs while chasing after Snape

\- yet again incapacitated several DEs throughout the entirety of DH

Harry is a natural fighter/duellist and his reflexes and instinct are almost unmatched. While luck and circumstance certainly played a part in some of his achievements - especially when it comes to the ones revolving around Voldemort specifically - the vast majority (and this is generous) of his peers would have failed at different times during the series if they were placed in the same situations, under the exact same conditions. Why? Because they simply didn't possess the same combined talent, bravery, willpower and resilience.",108,2024-10-27 14:52:57,0.9941

Yes.


>or were most of his accomplishments just based on circumstance and luck? 

Also yes.

Harry would be the first to admit that he had luck and help on his side during his adventures but he's also pretty talented and pretty powerful tbh. 

I've said it before but Harry is only really underwhelming when compared to top tiers like The Big Three (Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindelwald via scaling) and maybe the higher tiered adult wizards/witches like Snape and Bellatrix. Other than that, Harry is a child/teenager doing things that adults either have trouble or straight up are incapable of doing.

* Harry was able to learn how to cast a Patronus in a relatively short amount of time, impressing Lupin who said that it is a difficult spell to conjure. Not long afterwards, Harry was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus to drive away an army of dementors. Simply creating a corporeal Patronus is very difficult to do, something that is mentioned multiple times in the books. 

> 'Impressive,' said Madam Bones, staring down at him, 'a true Patronus at his age . . . very impressive indeed. ' Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads. (Order of the Phoenix)


* At the age of 14, Harry learned Stupefy, Impedimentia, Reducto, Accio, the Four-Point Spell, and Protego in the span of a few months, most of which are very useful in duels and some being fairly advanced. For example, Fred and George's Shield Hats were very popular among workers in the Ministry of Magic because this joke product makes fairly effective body armor for people who can't perform proper Shield charms (Protego).
> ""You wouldn't believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can't do a decent Shield Charm,"" said George. ""'Course, they didn't have you teaching them, Harry. "" >""That's right. . . Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought **five hundred** for all its support staff! And we're still getting massive orders!"" (Half-blood Prince)

Even an 18 year old Krum was impressed with 14 year old Harry's skill as a wizard:
> You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't, Viktor always said--'
> Ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck. Rubbing it, he said, 'Yeah? What did Vicky say?'
> 'Ho ho,' said Hermione in a bored voice. 'He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn't, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang. ' (Order of the Phoenix)

* Harry's Quidditch honed reflexes allow him to be extremely quick on the draw. 
> 'The dementors have left Azkaban,' said Malfoy quietly. 'Dad and the others'll be out in no time . . . '
> 'Yeah, I expect they will,' said Harry. 'Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now--'
> Malfoy's hand flew towards his wand, but Harry was too quick for him; he had drawn his own wand before Malfoy's fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes. (Order of the Phoenix)

* Harry is also quick enough to cast spells before his opponents could finish casting their own. 

> It was Harry's turn to laugh. 'Yeah, right!' he said. 'I give you this--prophecy, is it? And you'll just let us skip off home, will you?'
> The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked: 'Accio proph --'
> Harry was just ready for her: he shouted 'Protego' before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it.
> 'Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,' she said, her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. 'Very well, then--' (Order of the Phoenix)

And: 
> water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, ""Cruci --""
>""SECTUMSEMPRA!"" bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly. Blood spurted from Malfoy's face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand. (Half-Blood Prince)

* In the Battle of Seven Potters, Harry managed to take down at least three Death Eaters under less than ideal conditions. For comparison, Ron taking one under similar conditions merited high praise from Tonks (an experienced Auror).",24,2024-10-27 16:53:12,0.9983

Could he be the heir, could he belong in Slytherin, could the hat have made a mistake. 

Harry would do well in Slytherin. He Does have a lot of traits that Slytherin valued: ambition, drive, resourcefulness, LEADERSHIP. 
He tries to do everything HIMSELF How many times in the series? At least once a week for 7 years. He leads others into battle. He would make a great Slytherin. (Yes he also has a lot of Gryffindor traits too). 

BUT the house has a bad rep for being a BAD house. Malfoy just called Hermione a mud blood, the ‚Äòheir of Slytherin‚Äô is killing kids. Voldemort was a Slytherin and so were ‚Äòall‚Äô of his death eaters. 

So here he is, an insecure, abused, 12 year old boy who found out that he can speak to snakes, he doesn‚Äôt know who his family were, he has no one to ask. He‚Äôs just been dragged to the principles office after being caught at the scene of a crime. He sees the hat and he needs to know. So he asked. And he heard the one answer he DIDNT want to hear. So he pushed back, told the Hat it was wrong. When he voiced that, it was like a change that needed to happen. He didn‚Äôt doubt himself anymore, he found his bravery, he found his courage. He started trusting himself again.

"Reading the Chamber of secrets, and I had a thought about Ron's Christmas gift to Harry.","Ron gives Harry the Cannons book, so he could read all about rons favorite quidditch team. I was reading and I realized, and growing up poor myself, I had given away things that I liked to people for Christmas or their birthday,  because I didn't have the money to buy them something else. I would give away a book or a game I really liked and told them I thought they would like it, which was true, I tried to give them something they would enjoy, but it was more because I couldn't go to the store to buy toys or something for really anyone. Ron's gift made me think of this, and I wonder if Ron did the same thing.

"Reading the Chamber of secrets, and I had a thought about Ron's Christmas gift to Harry.","Ron gives Harry the Cannons book, so he could read all about rons favorite quidditch team. I was reading and I realized, and growing up poor myself, I had given away things that I liked to people for Christmas or their birthday,  because I didn't have the money to buy them something else. I would give away a book or a game I really liked and told them I thought they would like it, which was true, I tried to give them something they would enjoy, but it was more because I couldn't go to the store to buy toys or something for really anyone. Ron's gift made me think of this, and I wonder if Ron did the same thing.

It's not like Ron would have had the money to purchase another copy, anyway. It's bittersweet, because I grew up very poor and gave away most of my treasured possessions this way.

This hit me right in the feels.",1391,2020-06-18 23:21:25,-0.1177

I also believe it was because Harry had no real experience with quidditch teams, and Ron wanted his best friend to become a fan of his own favorite team.",363,2020-06-19 01:17:33,0.9682

I don‚Äôt think I ever gave away something of mine as a gift in this way. I would just buy another one. I feel pretty fortunate right now. I have worked with a lot of kids in poverty so I‚Äôm not completely disconnected but this isn‚Äôt something I realized was typical.
